% GW, motivation
Gravitational waves are ``ripples'' in spacetime emitted by massive astrophysical events. % that they carry away information about.
Over the past decade, interferometric detectors like the Advanced~Laser~Interferometric~Gravitational-Wave~Observatory have been used to measure gravitational waves with frequency around 100~Hz from the binary mergers of black holes and neutron stars and learn about such systems.
Other frequencies of gravitational waves are also thought to exist including kilohertz waves that are yet to be detected but could contain valuable information, e.g.\ 1--4~kHz gravitational waves from binary neutron star mergers could be used to further constrain the neutron star equation-of-state and better understand the exotic states of matter within.
% However, gravitational waves are predicted to be emitted from other sources but are yet to be detected because they are outside the sensitive frequency range, and therefore there is valuable astrophysical information that is currently going uncollected. For example, 1--4~kHz gravitational waves from the merger and post-merger remnant of binary neutron star systems are predicted to contain information that could be used to further constrain the neutron star equation-of-state and better understand the exotic states of matter within.
% The ability to detect kilohertz (around 1~kHz) gravitational waves could also lead to better understanding of the origin of low-mass black holes, the post-bounce dynamics of core-collapse supernovae, and the discovery of exotic or primordial sources in the stochastic gravitational-wave background.
% why they can't be seen
% existing proposals for kHz sensitivity
Current interferometric gravitational-wave detectors are not as sensitive at kilohertz because of a classical limit on their quantum noise--limited sensitivity and their use of optical cavities, where the quantum noise in the measurement comes from the fundamental quantum uncertainty in the state of the laser light. Existing proposals to improve kilohertz sensitivity either use quantum squeezing inside the detector to improve the quantum noise (e.g.\ degenerate internal squeezing) or counter the cavity resonance to improve the response to the gravitational-wave signal (e.g.\ optomechanical filtering). However, these two proposals require either low optical loss or mechanical loss, respectively.

In this thesis, I investigate nondegenerate internal squeezing, a configuration that combines these two existing proposals and has not been fully examined to date.
% conclusions
I use an analytic, Hamiltonian model to characterise this configuration's quantum noise--limited sensitivity, stability, squeezing threshold, tolerance to optical loss, and different readout schemes. For a realistic future gravitational-wave detector, I find that nondegenerate internal squeezing is more detection loss-resistant than degenerate internal squeezing and is a viable, all-optical alternative to stable optomechanical filtering. I also find that it could feasibly improve kilohertz gravitational-wave detection and that its promise for broadband 100--4000~Hz detection is further improved using a different readout scheme.
