\chapter*{Declaration}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Declaration}

This thesis is an account of research undertaken between February 2021 and October 2021 at the Centre for Gravitational Astrophysics, Research School of Physics and Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics, The Australian National University, Canberra, Australia.

Except where acknowledged in the customary manner, the material presented in this thesis is, to the best of my knowledge, original and has not been submitted in whole or part for a degree at any other university.

The research presented in this thesis was completed on the lands of the Ngunnawal and Ngambri people, the traditional owners of the land of The Australian National University's Canberra campus. I acknowledge that this land was stolen and sovereignty was never ceded, and pay my respects to the elders past and present.

% how to remove the "chapter 1" headings on the first page of a chapter: In your chapter itself, instead of "\chapter{First Chapter} use:  \chapter*{First Chapter} \chaptermark{First Chapter}

\include{introduction} 
	% motivation: kHz gravitational wave detection could lead to new physics
	% the problem: cannot increase power but want to increase HF sensitivity without sacrificing LF sensitivity
	% aims
	% outline

\include{background_theory}
	% Mizuno limit
	% cannot increase power
% Squeezing to improve quantum noise--limited sensitivity
	% mechanism of squeezing
	% optical loss
	% external squeezing
	% remaining problem of how to further increase kHz sensitivity

% should this background chapter be broken up? GWD's separately then theory of quantum noise?
