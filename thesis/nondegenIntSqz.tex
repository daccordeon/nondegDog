% chapter introduction

\jam{(Fix up mentions of nondegenerate internal squeezing in background chapters, either explain it earlier or do not confuse the reader)}

% combine the all-optical approach of dIS with the mode structure of sWLC
In this chapter, I present my analytic, Hamiltonian model of nondegenerate internal squeezing and discuss its immediate results.
%Nondegenerate internal squeezing is the same configuration as degenerate internal squeezing except that the squeezer is operated nondegenerately, but it is better thought of as an all-optical alternative to stable optomechanical filtering.
Firstly, I will review the limited literature available about nondegenerate internal squeezing, and conclude that the system with optical loss has never been fully characterised. Secondly, I will present my model and derive and characterise the sensitivity of the configuration. I will partially verify the model by demonstrating that it obeys the expected low and high loss limits, and I will show that the system is stable. Finally, I will find the threshold of nondegenerate internal squeezing using an observation that unites the different squeezing configurations in this thesis. 
% from the view of quantum optics, gravitational waves in the next chapter
This chapter is directed at understanding nondegenerate internal squeezing for general quantum metrology. In the following chapters, I will return to the problem of kilohertz gravitational-wave detection and whether nondegenerate internal squeezing can feasibly improve sensitivity. 


\section{Literature review}
% a gap in the literature, should be much shorter than the review in Section~\ref{sec:literature_review} -- maybe combine it with that one?
% cannot cite personal communication?
% claim: the modelling of this configuration has never been done as thoroughly as my work, explain why (recency of interest)

\jam{(How to be thorough with this section?)}

The available literature on nondegenerate internal squeezing is limited. Although nondegenerate OPOs have long been studied for tests of the EPR-paradox~\cite{Reid1989,Schori2001} and other applications~\cite{,,}, placing a nondegenerate squeezer in a coupled cavity system \jam{has only been studied in ... (I am not aware of any other mentions than Li2020, ask the supervisors.)}. 
Although nondegenerate internal squeezing is motivated by the two configurations in the previous chapter, those configurations have only been studied in the last few years, see Section~\ref{sec:literature_review}. \jam{(Is there direct mention of nIS in the dIS literature?)}
The only direct mention of nondegenerate internal squeezing \jam{(that I could find, check this!)} in the literature is the brief suggestion in Ref.~\cite{Li2020} that it is equivalent to stable optomechanical filtering in the lossless case. In that paper and subsequent work by the same authors~\cite{Li2021}, only mechanical loss is included in the model since it is the dominant source of loss. By the modal equivalence in Section~\ref{sec:modal_equivalence}, I predict that optical loss in the idler mode should be the dominant source of loss for nondegenerate internal squeezing but this is not known. Therefore, I identify this as a gap in the literature, no work has fully characterised nondegenerate internal squeezing with optical loss in every mode, which matters because understanding how the different losses behave determines the feasibility of the design for detection.
 % distribution of loss in applications might be far from uniform, e.g.\ how the detection loss is predicted to be higher than any of the intra-cavity losses for future gravitational-wave detectors~\cite{}.
Not only are the quantum noise and signal responses of the lossy system not known, but other aspects of understanding the system, such as its limits and the squeezing threshold, are not either. I partially fill this gap in this thesis \jam{(colloquial?)}.


\section{Analytic model}

	\caption{\jam{(Purpose: explain configuration)} \jam{(Placeholder figure. Needs idler mode and mode labels, integrate figures on right into configuration. This is the reference for the derivation, so explain as many symbols as possible.)} Nondegenerate internal squeezing configuration with all modes and losses labelled. The idler mode is not resonant in the arms. The system's response is shown using the signal arrow and noise ellipse representation from Fig.~\ref{fig:extSqz_config}. Compare to degenerate internal squeezing in Fig.~\ref{fig:dIS_config} and the nondegenerate OPO in Fig.~\ref{fig:nOPO_config}.}
	\label{fig:nIS_config}
\end{figure}

Nondegenerate internal squeezing consists of a nondegenerate squeezer placed inside the signal-recycling cavity of an interferometer, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_config}. It is the same configuration as degenerate internal squeezing, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:dIS_config}, except that the squeezer is operated nondegenerately, but it is better thought of as an all-optical alternative to stable optomechanical filtering, see Section~\ref{sec:modal_equivalence}. In the single-mode approximation, I consider the signal and idler modes resonant in the signal-recycling cavity, where the signal mode of the squeezer is at the carrier frequency $\omega_0$ and is resonant in the arms, while the idler mode at $\omega_0+\Delta$ is not resonant in the arms so that the arm and idler modes are not directly coupled, see Section~\ref{sec:modal_equivalence}. 
I model this configuration using the Hamiltonian method demonstrated several times in this thesis, and in particular, this model combines the nondegenerate OPO and degenerate internal squeezing models in Sections~\ref{sec:nOPO}~\ref{sec:dIS_model}, respectively. % There are no steps in this derivation that have not already appeared in this thesis \jam{(check this)}.
This model is based on and verified, in the lossless case, against Ref.~\cite{Li2020}. 
% \jam{(Probably need to talk about my methodology more -- state that this derivation presented is the last of a long line of increasing complexity (more losses, radiation pressure, pump phase, etc.) and that I have verified at each stage that the model recovers the previous model. This allowed me to also consider the impact of each subsequent addition in isolation. Moreover, I should re-emphasise that it reduces to the lossless case in Li and follows the same path as the verified models of dIS and the OPOs. The point is that this derivation is not controversial.)}
My methodology when constructing this model was to start with the lossless model in Ref.~\cite{Li2020} and progressively add each complication of optical loss in each mode, radiation pressure, and pump phase. At each stage of the progression, I verified that the model recovered the previous stage in the appropriate limits. This allowed me to study the effect of each complication separately rather than study the full model all at once. \jam{(need to be more critical of the approach?)} But, for brevity, I present the full model here.

Let the modes be labelled as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_config}, which is as in Section~\ref{sec:dIS_model} but with the addition of $\hat c$ for the idler mode as in Section~\ref{sec:nOPO}. The Hamiltonian of this system is $\hat H = \hat H_0 + \hat H_I + \hat H_\gamma + \hat H_\text{GW}$ where~\cite{} \jam{(fill in Langevin Hamiltonian)}
\begin{align}
\hat H_0 &= \hbar \omega_0 \hat a^\dag \hat a + \hbar \omega_0 \hat b^\dag \hat b+ \hbar (\omega_0+\Delta) \hat c^\dag \hat c + \hbar (2\omega_0+\Delta) \hat u^\dag \hat u\\
\hat H_I &= i\hbar\omega_s(\hat a\hat b^\dag-\hat a^\dag\hat b) + \hbar \frac{x}{2} (e^{i\phi} \hat u \hat b^\dag \hat c^\dag+e^{-i\phi} \hat u^\dag \hat b \hat c) \\
\hat H_\gamma &= \int \ldots \\
\hat H_\text{GW} &= -\alpha (\hat{x}-L_\mathrm{arm}h(t))\left(\frac{\hat{a}+\hat{a}^\dag}{\sqrt{2}}\right)+\frac{1}{2\mu}\hat{p}^2.
\end{align}
As before, $\hat H_0$ describes the decoupled optical system, $\hat H_I$ describes the interaction between the three intra-cavity modes, $\hat H_\gamma$ describes the input/output coupling through the readout and loss ports listed below, and $\hat H_\text{GW}$ describes the coupling to the gravitational-wave signal and the evolution of the test mass mechanical mode.
There is vacuum entering the system intra-cavity to all three modes $\hat n^L_a, \hat n^L_b, \hat n^L_c$, at the readout port $\hat B_\text{in}, \hat C_\text{in}$, and in the detection chain $\hat n^L_\text{PD}$ which will be included later. Only the vacuum entering the readout port is present in the lossless model.
The Heisenberg-Langevin equations-of-motion for these operators can be found as before, using the bosonic and canonical commutation relations with all other commutators zero. I again (1) make the semi-classical and no-pump-depletion approximations to simplify the pump mode $\hat u\mapsto u=2\chi/x$, these approximations are valid below threshold, (2) enter the Interaction Picture to ignore $\hat H_0$, and (3) take fluctuating components of each operator but keep it implicit in the notation ($\delta\hat{Q}(t)\mapsto\hat{Q}$) because it does not change the equations-of-motion \jam{(is this true? it is not clear to me)}. I find the equations-of-motion to be
\begin{equation}\label{eq:nIS_EoM}
\begin{cases}
\dot{\hat{a}}=-\omega_s\hat{b} - \gamma_a \hat{a} + \sqrt{2\gamma_a}\hat{n}^L_a+\frac{i}{\hbar}\alpha(\hat{x}-L_\mathrm{arm}h)\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\\
\dot{\hat{b}}=\omega_s\hat{a} - i\chi e^{i\phi}\hat{c}^\dagger - \gamma^b_\mathrm{tot} \hat{b} + \sqrt{2\gamma^b_R}\hat{B}_\mathrm{in} + \sqrt{2\gamma_b}\hat{n}^L_b\\
\dot{\hat{c}}=-i\chi e^{i\phi}\hat{b}^\dagger - \gamma^c_\mathrm{tot} \hat{c} + \sqrt{2\gamma^c_R}\hat{C}_\mathrm{in} + \sqrt{2\gamma_c}\hat{n}^L_c\\
\dot{\hat{x}}=\frac{1}{\mu}\hat{p}\\
\dot{\hat{p}}=\alpha\left(\frac{\hat{a}+\hat{a}^\dag}{\sqrt{2}}\right).
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
I solve these equations in the Fourier domain. Let $\vec{\hat b}(\Omega)=[\hat b(\Omega), \hat b^\dag(-\Omega), \hat c(\Omega), \hat c^\dag(-\Omega)]^\text{T}$, where I use the compact notation $\tilde{\delta\hat{Q}}(\Omega)\mapsto\hat{Q}(\Omega)$, with similar signal-idler vectorisation for each signal and idler mode as in Section~\ref{sec:nOPO} and $\vec h(\Omega)=\tilde h(\Omega) [1,1,0,0]^\text{T},\quad \vec{\hat a}(\Omega)=[\hat a(\Omega), \hat a^\dag(-\Omega),0,0]^\text{T}$ and similarly for $\vec{\hat n}^L_a(\Omega)$.

The total quantum noise is given by the spectral density matrix Eq.~\ref{eq:total_noise_matrix}, which simplifies, assuming uncorrelated vacuum at each loss port, to
\begin{equation}
\text{S}_X=\text{R}_\text{in}\text{R}_\text{in}^\dag+\text{R}^L_a{\text{R}^L_a}^\dag+\text{R}^L_b{\text{R}^L_b}^\dag+\text{R}^L_\text{PD}{\text{R}^L_\text{PD}}^\dag.
\end{equation} % same expression as dIS
Which is divided into 2 by 2 blocks of signal-signal, signal-idler, and idler-idler (co)variances as in Section~\ref{sec:nOPO} \jam{(are the signal-signal and idler-idler covariances all zero? how many freedoms remaining in the signal-idler covariances?)}. The pump phase only appears in the off-diagonal, signal-idler blocks.
The vector of signal transfer functions, with respect to $\tilde h(\Omega)$, to each signal and idler quadrature at the photodetector is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:nIS_sigRO_signal_response}
\text{T}\begin{bsmallmatrix}1 \\1\\0\\0\end{bsmallmatrix} = \frac{2 \beta \sqrt{1-R_\text{PD}} \omega_s}{(\gamma_a-i \Omega ) \left(\chi ^2-(\gamma^b_\text{tot}-i\Omega) (\gamma^c_\text{tot}-i\Omega)\right)-\omega_s^2 (\gamma^c_\text{tot}-i \Omega )} \begin{bsmallmatrix}0 \\-\sqrt{\gamma^b_R}(\gamma^c_\text{tot}-i\Omega)\\\sqrt{\gamma^c_R}\chi\cos(\phi)\\\sqrt{\gamma^c_R}\chi\sin(\phi)\end{bsmallmatrix}.
\end{equation}
Therefore, there is gravitational-wave signal in the second signal quadrature and each idler quadrature. For simplicity and to compare to Ref.~\cite{Li2020}, here I will consider measuring the second signal quadrature which I will refer to as signal readout, henceforth. However, this is not necessarily the optimum readout of the signal quadratures since the noise might be sufficiently lower in the first quadrature to preference a combined measurement. I will consider this and other readout schemes, such as measurements of the idler quadratures and combinations of the signal and idler quadratures, in Chapter~\ref{chp:idler_readout}.
Therefore, the sensitivity of the signal readout scheme, where $\sqrt{S_h}$ is the noise-to-signal ratio, is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:nIS_sigRO_sens}
S_h = \frac{(\text{S}_X)_{2,2}}{\abs{\left(\text{T}\begin{bsmallmatrix}1 \\1\\0\\0\end{bsmallmatrix}\right)_2}^2}.
\end{equation}
% verified these results by repeating the model with 2x2 matrices and 4x4 matrices, important to mention this because it is part of the methodology
\jam{(Include full expression in an appendix?)} I have partially verified this result by repeating the derivation using 2 by 2 matrices~\footnote{Which is not a physically meaningful difference, but it separates the signal and idler such that the derivations are not identical.}, and will compare it to known limits below. %in Section~\ref{sec:nOPO_reduction}.


\section{Results}
\label{sec:nIS_sigRO_results}

\jam{(Are these results quantitative enough?)}

I will now examine some of the immediate results of the model: (1) the general features of the signal and noise responses and sensitivity, (2) the reduction to known models in certain loss limits, and (3) the stability of the system.

\subsection{General behaviour}

Show the effect of increased readout rate on the signal?)} Nondegenerate internal squeezing signal readout with all losses included, showing quantum noise response (top panel), signal response (middle panel), and sensitivity (bottom panel). The effect of the squeezer and radiation pressure on the sensitivity is understood by examining the signal and noise. The slope of the radiation pressure noise with the squeezer on appears to change around 10~Hz which is an effect of losses, and the same effect causes the signal to not be amplified down to DC. The squeezer parameter is normalised to threshold which will be found later.}

Is this essential?)} \jam{(Should make plot below threshold, fix the idler loss legend to not include readout rate, show lower frequencies to show readout loss RPN.)} Nondegenerate internal squeezing separate noise transfer functions for each loss port and the total noise response. The detection loss only affects the shot noise after the interferometer and therefore is flat. The other losses are all squeezed and affected by the radiation-pressure noise because they are coupled indirectly to the signal-recycling and arm cavity modes. The readout port followed by the idler intra-cavity loss dominates the other losses, which is likely due to the relative size of the readout $T_\text{SRM}=0.046$ and loss rates and the tolerance to the different losses discussed in the next chapter.}
    \label{fig:nIS_sigRO_noise_budget}
\end{figure}

\jam{(should I show the lossless limit first?)}

% analyse typical nIS plot features before getting into different tests
The sensitivity of nondegenerate internal squeezing is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_general_sens} \jam{(for what parameters?)}. I examine the signal and noise responses separately to understand the origin of the features in the sensitivity curve.
With the squeezer off, the sensitivity curve is shaped by the radiation-pressure noise below 10~Hz and the signal response resonance at the sloshing frequency 5~kHz with bandwidth 500~Hz determined by the signal readout rate $\gamma^b_R$, as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:dIS_results}. With the squeezer turned on, (1) the shot noise is anti-squeezed around a frequency determined by the squeezer parameter, sloshing frequency, and loss rates; (2) the radiation-pressure noise worsens to now dominate below 100~Hz; and (3) the signal is amplified around the same frequency as the shot noise and at frequencies down to 10~Hz, below which it converges to the value without squeezing due to losses. These changes mean that the squeezer improves the sensitivity from 40--4000~Hz and worsens it outside that band except above 10~kHz where the sensitivity converges to the value without squeezing.
These quoted frequencies are specific to this parameter set but the general performance is the same: nondegenerate internal squeezing leads to improved sensitivity at some broad range of ``middle'' frequencies at the cost of ``low'' frequency sensitivity. 
Some of these effects will be explained later, e.g.\ the frequency around which the shot noise and the signal peak are amplified is determined by the threshold of the system, but some of these results can be explained immediately.
 % and the effect of losses will be left until I consider gravitational-wave detection feasibility.
% changing the signal response via the white-light cavity effect?
% why aren't the changes local to the sloshing frequency, like dIS?
The signal response is amplified by analogy to the filter (white-light) cavity effect of the optomechanical analogue, the resonance of the coupled cavity system is changed by introducing the idler mode \jam{(is this true? I am not sure. the signal response still falls off at the same rate so bandwidth doesn't seem to improve except by the LF amplification?)}. The change in the resonance behaviour from a two-mode to a three-mode coupled system means that the changes are not localised to the sloshing frequency, unlike degenerate internal squeezing in Section~\ref{sec:dIS_results} \jam{(check this, shouldn't this mean that they are still expected around the coupling frequencies?)}. 
%In the simple explanation of the signal-recycling cavity reflecting the light back into the arms to experience the gravitational wave more, the addition of the idler mode, which is not directly coupled to the arms or measured, somehow \jam{(how/why? this is wishy-washy)}.
% why does radiation pressure noise worsen?
% ~\footnote{I only talk about the radiation pressure noise where it is dominant, i.e.\ at ``low'' frequencies below the Standard Quantum Limit \jam{(is this necessary to say?)}}
Therefore, the radiation pressure noise at ``low'' frequencies can be affected. \jam{(why does the other quadrature appear now? is it worsened proportionally to the pump power?)}.

To understand how the radiation pressure noise is affected, I consider how it appears in each of the contributions to the total quantum noise, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_sigRO_noise_budget}. The radiation pressure noise appears in the contribution from the readout port and each intra-cavity loss port because these noises are coupled indirectly to the arm mode, unlike the detection loss which therefore has only shot noise. In particular, opening the idler readout port introduces more vacuum and turning the squeezer on indirectly couples the idler mode and this noise into the signal readout, which is why radiation pressure noise worsens by turning the squeezer on even when there are no losses \jam{(check this)}, which will be shown later in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_lossless}.
\jam{(why is the shot noise not amplified at LF?)}
% This is because the radiation pressure noise, with the gravitational-wave signal, enters the measured, second signal quadrature after the input test mass. Having already seen the arm cavity loss, it gets added here to each of the noises that travel through the signal mode \jam{(what am I trying to say?)}. It is then anti-squeezed \jam{(check this)} and read out.

% explain the effect of each parameter? (except leave tolerance to losses to science case chapter)
% in terms of the configuration parameters rather than derived parameters such as the sloshing frequency and readout rates
\jam{(Is this paragraph necessary? true? complete?)}
The effect of each configuration parameter is similar to the effect on the interferometer without squeezing in Sections~\ref{sec:intro_IFO}~\ref{sec:dIS_results}. To summarise, increasing the circulating power in the arms increases the sensitivity at all frequencies. Increasing the arm length increases the same scalar factor $\beta$ as the power but also reduces the free-spectral range of the signal response (i.e.\ the signal response falls off at a lower frequency) and decreases the sloshing (peak) frequency. The sloshing frequency also decreases with decreased input test mass transmission and longer signal-recycling cavities. Increasing the signal-recycling length decreases the bandwidth of the signal peak \jam{(Are there two bandwidths? The FSR of the arms sets where the signal falls off and the readout rate sets the smaller bandwidth around the sloshing frequency peak? If so, then clarify.)}, which is also decreased by decreased signal-recycling mirror transmission. The radiation-pressure noise increases with heavier test masses and increased pump power. Finally, increased pump power also increases the peak shot noise and signal amplification, and the pump phase does not affect signal readout. \jam{(I am claiming a lot here without figures or citations, what to include?)}


\subsection{Reduction to known systems}

% show that this follows from the EoM but can be verified by looking at the plots
To partially verify the model, I show that it reduces to the expected limits when (1) the losses are removed and (2) the arm loss is taken to infinity. I predict the behaviour by taking the limits of the equations-of-motion in Eq.~\ref{eq:nIS_EoM} and verify it by examining the plots of the noise and signal responses.

In the lossless limit, $\gamma_a=\gamma_b=\gamma_c=R_\text{PD}=0$, with the idler readout rate turned off, $\gamma^c_R=0$, the equations-of-motion of nondegenerate internal squeezing reduce to those of the lossless optomechanical analogue in Ref.~\cite{Li2020}.

I will compare the lossy all-optical and optomechanical analogues in the next chapter. 
% no losses means no antisqueezing of shot noise but yes RPN, why? threshold=0 problem?
Without losses, the shot noise is not anti-squeezed and the signal amplification persists down to DC. Since the idler readout rate is zero and there is no loss, the threshold is poorly defined because there is no mechanism for light to leave the idler mode, which will be discussed later. However, taking the limit of smaller and smaller losses shows that the shot noise peak decreases for fixed pump power below threshold \jam{(check this, why?)}. The DC signal amplification is lost when losses are added \jam{(why? compare lossless and lossy plots directly)}.

\end{figure}

% full 4x4 matrix agrees, not just variance 1,1
% give best explanation of ITM T=0, but can admit that while the maths is clear the physics is not obvious -- potentially requires more thought
In the high arm loss limit, $\gamma_a\rightarrow\infty$, the equations-of-motion of nondegenerate internal squeezing reduce to Eq.~\ref{eq:nOPO_EoM} for a nondegenerate OPO between the signal-recycling mirror and a fully-reflective input test mass. Comparing the shot noise of both systems, Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_signal_nOPO_limit} shows that the signal variances converge in the high arm loss limit, and by inspection the rest of the shot noise matrix $\text{S}_X$ also converges. This is similar to how the shot noise of degenerate internal squeezing converges to that of a degenerate OPO with the input test mass fully reflective, see Fig.~\ref{fig:dIS_limit_dOPO}, where the same explanation holds for why the mirror is fully reflective as Section~\ref{sec:dIS_optical_loss}. 

% therefore mystery of the idler loss carries over: idler loss cannot be zero
Therefore, for a given set of losses, nondegenerate internal squeezing exists somewhere between the lossless optomechanical analogue and the nondegenerate OPO. And so, I expect features to be inherited from these limiting configurations, such as how the fact that threshold is poorly defined when idler loss is zero is inherited from the nondegenerate OPO.


\subsection{Stability}
\label{sec:nIS_stability}

% plot: imaginary part of poles
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{nIS_stability.pdf}
	\caption{\jam{(Purpose: show stability)} \jam{(Normalise x-axis to threshold. Use print to remove $\{,\}$. Omit real part? Does this stability plot make sense? Supervisors requested Nyquist plots etc.\ at some point, is that still necessary?)} Stability of nondegenerate internal squeezing, for lossless (left panel) and lossy (right panel) cases. Showing the imaginary part of the poles of the transfer functions as when the imaginary part becomes positive the system becomes unstable~\cite{}. The lossless system is stable below threshold. \jam{And the lossy system is ... (find this out)}}
	\label{fig:nIS_stability}
\end{figure}

Stability is a feature of nondegenerate internal squeezing that might not be fully inherited from its limiting configurations. I use the same method to determine stability as Section~\ref{sec:dIS_results}. Like degenerate internal squeezing, the signal and noise transfer functions are rational functions of $\Omega, \chi$ with denominators~\footnote{I state these for the modulus-squared transfer functions, i.e.\ the numerator and denominator in Eq.~\ref{eq:nIS_sigRO_sens}, but the poles, i.e.\ zeros of $q$, do not change under the square root.} given by $q(\Omega,\chi)$ and $\Omega^4 q(\Omega,\chi) q(\Omega,-\chi)$, respectively, except that here $q$ only depends on $\chi^2$ and so the noise transfer function denominator is $\Omega^4 q(\Omega,\chi)^2$, where $q$ is some polynomial in $\Omega, \chi$, 
\begin{align}\label{eq:nIS_denom}
q(\Omega,\chi)&=\left(\gamma_a^2+\Omega ^2\right) \left(\Omega ^2 \left({\gamma^b_\text{tot}}^2+{\gamma^c_\text{tot}}^2+2 \chi ^2\right)+\left({\gamma^b_\text{tot}} {\gamma^c_\text{tot}}-\chi ^2\right)^2+\Omega ^4\right)\\
&-2 \omega_s^2 \left(\gamma_a {\gamma^c_\text{tot}} \chi ^2-\gamma_a {\gamma^b_\text{tot}} \left({\gamma^c_\text{tot}}^2+\Omega ^2\right)+\Omega ^2 \left({\gamma^c_\text{tot}}^2+\chi ^2+\Omega ^2\right)\right)+\omega_s^4 \left({\gamma^c_\text{tot}}^2+\Omega ^2\right).
\end{align}
This means that the zeros of the transfer functions are the shared zeros of $q$, except for the radiation-pressure noise singularity at $\Omega=0$ which I ignore because it comes from the horizontally free-falling mass assumption and is a pole on the real axis. That the rest of the poles are shared is expected because the stability of the system should be the same for the signal and noise \jam{(should it?)}~\cite{}.
Therefore, nondegenerate internal squeezing is unstable if any of the complex $\Omega$ zeros of $q$ have a positive imaginary part. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_stability}, the lossless system is stable for all $\chi\leq\omega_s$ and the lossy system is stable for \jam{... (complete after normalising lossy plot to threshold)}. I will show shortly that this means that nondegenerate internal squeezing is stable below threshold, like its two limiting configurations. Because the no-pump-depletion assumption breaks above threshold, the behaviour there cannot be inferred from Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_stability}.
% non-effect of RP, pump phase
Since Eq.~\ref{eq:nIS_denom} only depends on the pump power, readout and loss rates, and sloshing frequency, other factors, such as radiation pressure or pump phase, do not affect the zeros of $q$ or the stability.


\section{Singularity threshold}
\label{sec:singularity_threshold}
% motivate this by the previous section's looking at poles, now looking at real poles that could be encountered, to avoid confusion with the complex poles that are always present I will call these real poles ``singularities''

% \jam{(Emphasise that this is original work and that it is a clever approach.)}
As established in Sections~\ref{sec:dOPO_threshold}~\ref{sec:nOPO_results}~\ref{sec:dIS_results}, the threshold of a squeezing system is the boundary where gains balance losses and the no-pump-depletion assumption breaks. Finding the threshold of nondegenerate internal squeezing is required to understand where this model is valid and, experimentally, how high the pump power can be raised without lasing. Although threshold is well-understood for the OPOs and lossless degenerate internal squeezing, the threshold of lossy degenerate and nondegenerate internal squeezing is not available in the literature \jam{(check this)}. In this section, I present my method for determining threshold in all of these models, which uses the no-pump-depletion assumption.
To explain how I devised this method, since lossless degenerate internal squeezing on threshold has a minimum squeezed quadrature of zero, I initially tried to maximise the anti-squeezed quadrature of nondegenerate internal squeezing against $\Omega,\chi$. But performing this numerically encountered division-by-zero errors which prompted me to examine the transfer functions and find the singularities, i.e.\ the real zeros of $q$, analytically. The key insight was then realising that both the OPOs have singularities at $\Omega=0$ in the anti-squeezed quadrature on threshold.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{nIS_on_threshold.pdf}
    \caption{\jam{(Purpose: show that singularity threshold actually gives singularities -- is this necessary?)} Nondegenerate internal squeezing noise, signal, and sensitivity when approaching and at threshold. At threshold, the no-pump-depletion assumption breaks and the transfer functions are singular. The finiteness of the peaks in the noise and signal responses and the appearance of a peak in the sensitivity are due to numerical error and limited sampling \jam{(check this)}. For the threshold behaviour of the other configurations in this thesis see Figs.~\ref{fig:dOPO_variances}~\ref{fig:nOPO_variances}~\ref{fig:dIS_sensitivity}~\ref{fig:sWLC_sensitivity}.}
    \label{fig:nIS_on_threshold}
\end{figure}

My method to determine threshold is to define the ``singularity threshold'' as the smallest non-negative~\footnote{Because pump phase is included explicitly in the models, the squeezer parameter is non-negative.} value of the squeezing parameter such that the anti-squeezed quadrature of the quantum noise has a singularity at some (real) frequency. In particular, I look for points where the anti-squeezed quadrature, i.e.\ any of the diagonal terms of $\text{S}_X$, diverges to infinity in $(\Omega,\chi)\subset\mathbb{R}^2$ space~\footnote{To reduce confusion, I do not call these points poles since, unlike when considering stability, I am restricting $\Omega$ to be real and so the transfer function is not defined on $\mathbb{C}$.}. %Since I include the pump phase in my models, $\chi$ is further restricted to be positive.  \jam{(Check this: looking at the imaginary part of the poles for stability and looking for real poles (i.e. poles on the real axis) for threshold are the same solutions, surely?)}
Defining threshold with respect to anti-squeezing is better than squeezing because the singularities of the anti-squeezed quadrature are expected to be robust to losses, unlike the zeros of the squeezed quadrature, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:dOPO_variances}. 
I find the (real~\footnote{The reality condition is used to simplify the zeros of $q$, as in the solution for $\chi^2$ there is an imaginary component that, when set to zero, gives the real $\Omega$ solution.}) singularities of the noise transfer function (squared) $S_X$, i.e.\ the zeros of its denominator, for each squeezing configuration in this thesis to be at \jam{(check that $\gamma_c\mapsto\gamma^c_\text{tot}$)}

% frequency around which shot noise and signal are amplified in fig:nIS_general_sens is determined (but not exactly) the threshold frequency
% which pole is chosen tells us the closeness to nOPO or lossless sWLC
Where these values are verified by plotting the noise transfer function and observing the singularity, e.g.\ as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_on_threshold}. For squeezer parameter just below threshold, e.g.\ $\chi=0.95\chi_\text{thr}$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_general_sens}, the peak frequency around which the shot noise and signal are amplified is determined by the threshold frequency~\footnote{Consider this peak as a slice with constant $\chi$ of the region around the singularity in (real) $\Omega,\chi$ space.}. If multiple singularities are listed above, the singularity threshold is determined by the smallest $\chi$ value $$\chi_\text{thr}=\min_{i\in\{1,2\}}(\chi_i),\quad\Omega_\text{thr}=\Omega_{\underset{i\in\{1,2\}}{\text{argmin}}(\chi_i)}.$$ Which singularity has the smallest squeezer parameter changes as the losses change, and, by inspection for internal squeezing, where it changes the singularities merge which makes the singularity threshold continuous. The smallest squeezer parameter gives the first singularity hit when the pump power is increased from zero. The merging of the singularities could also be used, informally, as the point where the lossy configuration becomes closer in behaviour to the OPO limit than to the lossless configuration.

Singularity threshold recovers the known threshold values for the OPOs from Sections~\ref{sec:dOPO_threshold}~\ref{sec:nOPO_results} by inspection, degenerate internal squeezing from Section~\ref{sec:dIS_results}, and the optomechanical analogue from Section~\ref{sec:sWLC}. %, but its behaviour with loss is more complex for internal squeezing. 
For degenerate internal squeezing, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:dIS_threshold_traj}, in the lossless case the singularities $(\Omega,\chi)$ are at $(0,\infty)$ and $(\omega_s,\gamma^b_\text{tot})$ which recovers $(\Omega_\text{thr},\chi_\text{thr})\xrightarrow[\gamma_a\rightarrow0]{}(\omega_s,\gamma^b_\mathrm{tot})$ from Section~\ref{sec:dIS_results}. As the arm loss $\gamma_a$ is increased from zero, the singularities move and merge at the $\Omega=0$ axis when $\gamma_a=\omega_s$, and then the remaining singularity converges to the degenerate OPO threshold $(\Omega_\text{thr},\chi_\text{thr})\xrightarrow[\gamma_a\rightarrow\infty]{}(0,\gamma^b_\mathrm{tot})$ in the high arm loss limit, as expected.
% this resolves the mystery of idler loss --> means that lossless nIS is necessarily above threshold and therefore not allowed in this model except in formal limits, pump depletion would need to be added in to properly compare to sWLC?
For nondegenerate internal squeezing, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_threshold_traj} for fixed signal loss $T_{l,b}=0.1$ \jam{(not useful, set to zero)} and no idler readout rate $\gamma^c_R=0$ to compare to the optomechanical analogue, in the lossless limit $\gamma_a=0,\gamma_c\rightarrow0$ the singularities approach $(0,\infty)$ and $(0,\omega_s)$ which recovers the $\chi_\text{thr}=\omega_s$ analogue to the exceptional value $\chi_m=\omega_s$ from Section~\ref{sec:sWLC}. Where the same principle of gains and losses applies to the signal and mechanical idler modes which are driven by a blue-detuned pump laser~\cite{} \jam{(this detail is missing from sWLC section, add it in there)}. Moreover, the marginal stability of the optomechanical system at $\chi_m=\omega_s$ means that a pole in the complex $\Omega$ plane has moved on to the real axis and therefore is a (real) singularity. As the idler loss $\gamma_c$ is increased from zero with arm loss $\gamma_a=0$, one singularity remains at $(0,\infty)$ and the other converges to $(\omega_s,\sqrt{\gamma^b_\text{tot}\gamma_c})$ when $\gamma_c\rightarrow\infty$. Fixing the idler loss at $T_{l,c}=0.1$ and changing the arm loss $\gamma_a$~\footnote{Threshold remains poorly defined when the idler loss is zero \jam{(check where this step is in the derivation)} like the nondegenerate OPO in Section~\ref{sec:nOPO_results}. The lossless limit requires $\gamma^c_\text{tot}\rightarrow0$ to be taken formally.}, the singularities merge \jam{(check this)} at the $\Omega=0$ axis when $\gamma^c_\text{tot}\omega_s^2=\gamma_a\omega_s^2+\mathcal{O}(\gamma_a^2)$ which, assuming that $\gamma_a$ is small compared to $\omega_s$~\footnote{Which is reasonable for a gravitational-wave interferometer with $T_{l,a}=100\text{ppm}$ where $\gamma_a/(2\pi)<1$~Hz but $\omega_s/(2\pi)=5$~kHz.}, is approximately \jam{(redundant with $\approx$?)} when $\gamma_c\approx\gamma_a$. In the high arm loss limit $\gamma_a\gg\gamma_c$, the remaining singularity converges to the nondegenerate OPO threshold $(\Omega,\chi)\xrightarrow[\gamma_a\rightarrow\infty]{}(0,\sqrt{\gamma^b_\mathrm{tot}\gamma_c})$, as expected.

% $\Omega^4$ factor in RP denominator is the resonance, but is unrelated to the squeezer
% pump phase does not change threshold either
Singularity threshold is not affected by radiation pressure or pump phase since they do not affect the zeros of the denominator $q$ of the noise transfer function. As explained in the stability analysis in Section~\ref{sec:nIS_stability}, although the radiation pressure does introduce (1) a zero at $\Omega=0$ and (2) a factor $q(\Omega,-\chi)$, these can be ignored because, respectively, (1) comes from the free-falling mass assumption which is only valid at frequencies above the actual test mass resonance and therefore the physical behaviour will not have this singularity and (2) only increases the multiplicity of the zeros because the result is independent of pump phase and therefore of the sign of $\chi$. The pump phase is irrelevant because the singularity threshold looks at the anti-squeezed quadrature, which always exists by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, but does not depend on where in the quadrature basis it lies.


\subsection{Problems with definition}

Although singularity threshold achieves all the known limits for the configurations considered and is simple to determine once the noise transfer function is known, it has two main problems to address: (1) how it relates to gain-loss balancing and (2) how maximising the anti-squeezed quadrature relates to minimising the squeezed quadrature. 
% what about other configurations
Although my arguments should apply generally to squeezed cavity systems, I will only consider the aforementioned configurations and leave a general treatment of singularity threshold to future work.

\subsubsection{Physical meaning of singularity threshold}
% Preliminary work?
% noise transfer function is the ratio of the spectrum out to the spectrum in, if the OPO starts lasing then the output has a coherent amplitude but the input is vacuum. FT is steady state

% why does lossless threshold for nIS depend on omega_s while for dIS it does not? because idler mode with zero loss behaves badly
% dIS: what does omega_s^2/\gamma_a represent? the amount of light that returns from the arms?
\jam{(Is this paragraph necessary?)}
The physical meaning of singularity threshold is unclear, e.g.\ consider the difference between the lossless limits of the degenerate and nondegenerate internal squeezing cases. For degenerate internal squeezing $\chi_\text{thr}=\gamma^b_R$, while for the nondegenerate case $\chi_\text{thr}=\sqrt{\gamma^b_R(\gamma^c_R+\frac{\omega_s^2}{\gamma^b_R+\gamma^c_R})}$. In either case, the arm loss is zero, so there is no gain or loss associated with the arms or, presumably, the sloshing frequency, but the latter case depends on $\omega_s$ \jam{(why?)}. I suspect that this difference arises because the idler is not coupled directly to the arms \jam{(explain more, this could also be checked by coupling directly)}. The gain-loss balance, although simple in the single-mode degenerate OPO, is more complicated to derive with more modes. This motivates the need for methods, like singularity threshold, to find threshold systematically, but these methods must be physically justified. 

\jam{(This section lacks a key argument, fix it.)}

Singularity threshold relies on the appearance of a singularity in the anti-squeezed quadrature to detect when the no-pump-depletion assumption has been broken. The no-pump-depletion approximation is valid well below threshold, when gain $\ll$ loss, and is less and less accurate closer and closer to threshold~\cite{}. At threshold~\footnote{Or, more formally, for squeezer parameter infinitesimally above threshold.}, where gain and loss balance, the squeezed cavity starts lasing, energy is lost from the pump mode, and the assumption breaks. The variance of the anti-squeezed quadrature of the output noise is singular at this point because \jam{... (why? this is not clear!)}.
% infinite fluctuations does not mean increase in time average
Where the (Fourier domain spectral density) variance of a fluctuating component of a quadrature being singular should not be confused with a change in the time average of that quadrature; the former occurs at singularity threshold and the latter is the change in the coherent amplitude expected to occur at threshold. % an explanation should link these
It suffices to understand this for the OPOs because the position of the singularity(s) is continuous, i.e.\ the singularity is robust to losses \jam{(is this formally true?)}.
Therefore, singularity threshold can be understood as \jam{... (complete this when I figure it out)}.

% will this all evaporate when pump depletion is added? yes, its likely
% be critical of approach! instead of finding a work-around for an assumption, should I just remove the no-pump-depletion assumption?
Using singularity threshold is perhaps unsatisfying because it uses the breaking of an assumption to determine when a physical effect occurs. Instead, the assumption could be dropped and pump depletion included in the model~\cite{,}, from which threshold could be determined by examining when the coherent amplitude of the output field is non-zero~\footnote{The coherent amplitudes were discarded in the Hamiltonian model when fluctuating components $\delta\hat{Q}(t)$ were taken.}. I leave this to future work with my prediction that it would agree with the singularity threshold \jam{(why? I should not make this claim without argument)} but would be more convincing. 

\subsubsection{Disagreement between squeezed and anti-squeezed quadratures}
% Degenerate internal squeezing - different notions of threshold
%shouldn't this be in the dIS sub-chapter? no.
% make clear that knowing threshold just gives the physical bounds of the parameter space, it doesn't correspond to the optimal squeezing (see results section) for sensitivity improvement -- just as minimising N does not necessarily maximise SNR if signal is not considered. 
% \jam{(One explanation for the difference between position of the singularity of the anti-squeezed quadrature and the minimum of the squeezed quadrature is that the expression for the sloshing frequency in Korobko et al, 2019 is not valid at large arm losses. If this is so, then what does this fixed--sloshing frequency Hamiltonian correspond to? And for that system, why does the supposedly Gaussian squeezing not maximise antisqz at the frequency that it minimises squeezing? --> Look at pump phase and/or covariance matrix)}

This difference is only significant in the high arm loss regime that is unlike \jam{(word choice?)} future detectors. \jam{(Answer why squeezing is so small -- see Bram's question (it is just down to the parameters chosen, sloshing frequency and bandwidth, being poorly suited to dIS))}}
	\label{fig:dIS_on_threshold}
\end{figure}

\jam{(Keep this short, I care about nIS not dIS.)}
For degenerate squeezing, singularity threshold is where the anti-squeezed quadrature diverges and therefore has the maximum peak value, but this does not necessarily correspond to where the squeezed quadrature has the minimum peak value~\footnote{Throughout this discussion I am only optimising the quantum noise and not the sensitivity.}, i.e.\ where the peak is the most squeezed towards zero. This is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:dIS_on_threshold} where the minimum squeezing occurs at $76\%$ \jam{(check this)} singularity threshold and the relative difference is only large (above a percent threshold) in the high arm loss limit \jam{(quantify this)}. This does not violate the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle because the losses increase the uncertainty product~\cite{}, i.e.\ , inefficiently, the anti-squeezed variance is increased more than the squeezed variance is decreased~\footnote{But the squeezing remains Gaussian~\cite{}, i.e.\ the squeezed noise ellipse's area is increased but remains an ellipse with semi-axes that represent the standard deviations of the Gaussian noise in each quadrature. \jam{(check this)}}.  
% The extrema, of which there are a maximum of two at any point, start at the same points, but have different trajectories, e.g.\ the first point moving initially into the $\Omega>\omega_s$ region instead, and merge at the different point on the y-axis, but converge to the same OPO limit (although the numerical sampling does not show it here). This difference does not violate the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle \jam{(but why does it occur?)}.
Singularity threshold uses singularities of the anti-squeezed quadrature rather than zeroes of the squeezed quadrature because the former are robust to losses unlike the latter, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:dIS_on_threshold} where the minimum is not at zero. Since zeros might not exist, if instead the minima of the squeezed quadrature were used to similarly define threshold, then their trajectories in (real) $(\Omega,\chi)$ space would be as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:dIS_threshold_traj}. These trajectories achieve the same limits as but diverge from the singularity trajectories. But this difference is only significant \jam{(quantify)} with high arm losses that are far above realistic cavity-based detectors, e.g.\ Fig.~\ref{fig:dIS_on_threshold} uses $T_{l,a}=800000~\text{ppm}$ compared to $100~\text{ppm}$ predicted for future gravitational-wave detectors. Therefore, because of this and that I am studying nondegenerate squeezing, this problem is not of concern for using singularity threshold in nondegenerate internal squeezing \jam{(what about combined readout?)}. I do not understand why this difference occurs \jam{(check this)}, however, two possible explanations are that it comes from the different shapes of the limiting curves for each quadrature of the lossy degenerate OPO in Fig.~\ref{fig:dOPO_variances} or that the approximation to the sloshing frequency in Section~\ref{sec:dIS_model} breaks down in the high arm loss limit~\footnote{In which case this model might not represent the physical system in that limit.}~\cite{}.


Despite these two problems with singularity threshold, since the first problem cannot be resolved without deriving a pump-depletion model for the system that has not yet been done \jam{(which I avoid why?)} and the second problem is not relevant to nondegenerate internal squeezing, singularity threshold remains the only known value of threshold for nondegenerate internal squeezing~\cite{}. Therefore, henceforth, I will use the ratio to singularity threshold to normalise the squeezer parameter between different losses, and I leave resolving these remaining problems to future work. 
\jam{(should I be more positive here?)}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Chapter summary}

In this chapter, I have derived and characterised a Hamiltonian model of nondegenerate internal squeezing. Firstly, I identified that a dedicated study of lossy nondegenerate internal squeezing was absent from the literature but was motivated by the promising performance of the related configurations in the previous chapter. Secondly, using the methods from the previous chapters, I derived the quantum noise--limited sensitivity and stability of the system, and discussed the general features of its signal and noise responses. I partially verified this analytic model by showing that it reduced to the known limits. Finally, I presented a \jam{(should I say my?)} technique to find the threshold of nondegenerate internal squeezing using the singularities of the anti-squeezed quadrature which appear when the pump-depletion assumption is broken \jam{(check this)}. I justified this singularity threshold by showing that it reduced to the known values for the other configurations in this thesis, and, despite some remaining issues with its physicality, I will use it to normalise the squeezer parameter. 
The results presented in this chapter apply generally to cavity-based metrology and I will apply them in the following chapters to gravitational-wave detection.

\chapter{Nondegenerate internal squeezing for gravitational-wave detection}
\label{chp:science_case}

% be clear about the scope of this project, I am not wanting to recommend the design of the next detector to be built, this is exploratory work into a configuration that has never been modelled this thoroughly before -- more would need to be done (e.g. add in external squeezing and thermal noise etc.) to make a proper judgement which is not my aim.
% comparison to existing proposals
% conclusions from this chapter: nIS is feasible as an alternative to sWLC and to improve the sensitivity from 100-1000 Hz, but improving 1-4 kHz sensitivity appears less likely without changing the sloshing frequency and arm bandwidth

In this chapter, I consider using nondegenerate internal squeezing in a future gravitational-wave detector. This is exploratory work and I will not recommend the optimal configuration for a future detector which would require a more detailed model. Instead, I will focus on the general feasibility of nondegenerate internal squeezing and whether it warrants further investigation.
Firstly, I will examine the tolerance of nondegenerate internal squeezing to the realistic optical losses in a future detector like LIGO~Voyager as described in Chapter~\ref{chp:proposals}. I will also discuss the optimal squeezing value for the sensitivity. Secondly, I will compare the sensitivity of nondegenerate internal squeezing to stable optomechanical filtering and argue that the low optical loss required for the all-optical configuration is as least as realistic as the low mechanical loss required for the optomechanical configuration, meaning that the nondegenerate internal squeezing is a viable, all-optical alternative. I will also compare its tolerance to optical loss to degenerate internal squeezing. Finally, I will compare the sensitivity to the target for kilohertz gravitational-wave detection from Section~\ref{sec:GW_kilohertz_target}. I will find that the kilohertz improvement is promising enough to warrant further investigation. Although this work was motivated by improving kilohertz sensitivity, I will also discuss whether the configuration is better suited to a broadband detector. %, which will be further explored in the next chapter.

% summarise the constraints from Chapter 3, give the table of parameters
I will compare how the sensitivity of nondegenerate internal squeezing degrades with each of the optical losses in the model. I will use the parameter set in Section~\ref{sec:literature_review}, which is from Ref.~\cite{Li2020} and based on LIGO~Voyager but with a different readout rate and sloshing frequency, and the realistic losses from Section~\ref{sec:dIS_optical_loss}. I will vary the signal readout rate of the detector by changing the length of the signal-recycling cavity \jam{(clarify that the signal-recycling mirror transmissivity could also be changed, and try this. Explain why the sensitivity does not improve at 50~kHz readout rate.)}~\footnote{Since I fix the sloshing frequency $\omega_s$ and change the signal readout rate $\gamma^b_\text{tot}$, if the signal-recycling cavity length changes then so must the input test mass transmissivity.}, as the range of future detectors considered in the literature can be partially characterised by different readout rates~\cite{}. \jam{(Do I need a table of parameters here?)} E.g.\ the sloshing frequencies of Refs.~\cite{,,} lie within 2--6~kHz but their signal readout rates vary from 0.5--90~kHz. As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:literature_review}, I compromise which parameters are fixed (e.g.\ circulating power, sloshing frequency) and which are varied (e.g.\ readout rate, losses, pump power) because I cannot examine the entire parameter space, which is why I do not claim that these parameters are optimal. For this parameter set, I consider the tolerance to the four losses, detection, signal, idler, and arm, in turn.

% resistant to detection losses, which is a big deal, although Caves's amplifier could alleviate this more generally
Firstly, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_sigRO_tolerance_Rpd}, detection loss affects nondegenerate internal squeezing similarly to the base coupled-cavity interferometer except around the anti-squeezed peak, and its tolerance does not depend on the readout rate. Detection loss uniformly scales down the signal response and pulls the noise response towards the vacuum value. At the peak and when radiation pressure noise dominates, the quantum noise is far enough above the vacuum level that the reduction in noise and signal are roughly the same and the sensitivity does not worsen. Away from the peak, the tolerance diminishes as the anti-squeezing decreases but the tolerance to detection loss is never worse than the base interferometer. This is unlike degenerate internal squeezing for the same losses in Section~\ref{sec:dIS_optical_loss} where the reliance on squeezing instead of anti-squeezing makes that system more vulnerable to detection loss. However, both configurations can improve the detection loss by the inclusion of a Caves's amplifier from Section~\ref{sec:cavess_amp} which uses the same principle of anti-squeezing.

% resistant to signal loss, sensitive to arm loss, very sensitive to idler loss (SRM must be closed to idler through e.g. dichroic)
Secondly, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_sigRO_tolerance_Tlb}, signal mode intra-cavity loss at the realistic level has a negligible \jam{(quantify)} effect on nondegenerate internal squeezing. This is because the signal mode is dominated by loss through the readout port at $T_\text{SRM}=0.046=46000$~ppm compared to $T_{l,b}=1000~\text{ppm}$, where to change the readout rate I fix the transmissivity of the signal-recycling mirror and change the cavity length \jam{(why don't I just change Tsrm? do this to compare.)}. However, in the high signal loss limit, e.g.\ $T_{l,b}=0.1$, the loss dominates the readout rate, the peak frequency changes because the singularity threshold frequency is affected, and the tolerance worsens with the readout rate. \jam{(why?)} % because the bandwidth of the peak increases or the shorter cavity length at high readout rates also increases the intra-cavity loss rate?
But this is not of concern to future detectors which are in the low signal loss regime.

% changing the readout rate changes the cavity length and therefore increases the idler loss
Thirdly, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_sigRO_tolerance_Tlc}, idler intra-cavity loss at the realistic level with zero idler readout rate already significantly degrades the sensitivity \jam{(quantify)}. And opening the idler readout port is equivalent to further increasing the idler loss for signal readout~\footnote{E.g.\ a readout port symmetric between signal and idler increases the idler loss to a transmissivity of $0.046$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_sigRO_tolerance_Tlc} \jam{(update this if Tsrm changes)}.}. Therefore, the idler readout port should be closed for signal readout. Increasing the idler loss changes the peak frequency because of the singularity threshold frequency, but unlike signal loss, it also decreases the radiation-pressure noise \jam{(why?)}. With zero idler readout rate, the decrease in sensitivity from 100-1000~Hz by increasing $T_{l,c}$ from 100 to 1000~ppm is similar to introducing $50\%$ detection loss \jam{(check this, does this idler loss dominate 0.1 detection loss?)}. This effect is increased at higher signal readout rates because as the length of the cavity decreases all of the signal and idler loss rates increase \jam{(fix this?)}. 
% idler loss modal equivalence to mechanical loss dominating sWLC?
That idler loss is the dominant~\footnote{As measured in sensitivity change due to optical loss. The vacuum from the signal readout port is still the main vacuum source.} optical loss with these realistic losses \jam{(check this)} agrees with the optomechanical analogue being dominated by mechanical loss in the mechanical idler mode, see Section~\ref{sec:sWLC_loss}. Unlike detection loss or the vacuum from the readout port, idler intra-cavity loss cannot be lowered by the use of external squeezers from Section~\ref{sec:external_squeezing}, making it a greater problem for using this configuration in future detectors.

Finally, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_sigRO_tolerance_Tla}, arm intra-cavity loss at the realistic level below 100~ppm has a negligible \jam{(quantify)} effect on the sensitivity. Although in the high arm loss limit in Section~\ref{sec:nOPO_reduction}, the noise response changes to become closer to a nondegenerate OPO than the lossless system, future detectors lie outside this regime since the realistic arm loss is small. 
% Namely, future detectors lie in the regime explained in Section~\ref{sec:singularity_threshold} where the singularities have not merged, given by $$\gamma^c_\text{tot}\omega_s^2\geq\gamma_a\left(\omega_s^2+\gamma_a(\gamma^b_\mathrm{tot}+\gamma^c_\text{tot})\right).$$
But this limit explains the change in behaviour for $T_{l,a}=0.01$ \jam{(why not when it's equal to idler loss?)} in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_sigRO_tolerance_Tla} when the signal readout rate is large \jam{(why?)}.

% summarise tolerances, noise budget in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_sigRO_noise_budget}
Therefore, for realistic losses, nondegenerate internal squeezing is dominated by idler loss whether or not the idler readout port is open, the detection loss has a smaller effect \jam{(quantify)}, and signal and arm intra-cavity losses have negligible effects. This result agrees with the analysis of Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_sigRO_noise_budget} from Section~\ref{sec:nIS_general_behaviour} \jam{(can this section be shortened by using that plot instead?)} and the optomechanical analogue in Section~\ref{sec:sWLC_loss}.

% plot optimal squeezing curve (blue-green swoosh)

Compare the curve without detection loss to degenerate internal squeezing in Fig.~\ref{fig:dIS_optimal_squeezing}.}
	\label{fig:nIS_optimum_squeezing}
\end{figure}

\jam{(Is this subsection necessary?)}

% emphasise that threshold is not optimal squeezing for sensitivity
% Without detection loss, the optimal squeezing parameter for sensitivity is below threshold because the probe frequency is higher than the on-threshold peak frequency and with increased squeezer parameter the peak moves to lower frequencies. After the peak passes the probe frequency \jam{(show this?)} the signal and the noise start decreasing \jam{(check this)}. Increasing detection loss $R_\text{PD}$ decreases the signal $T$ as $\sqrt{1-R_\text{PD}}T$.
The optimal amount of squeezing for the maximum sensitivity is not necessarily on threshold. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_optimum_squeezing}, the sensitivity at a probe frequency, here 2.5~kHz, peaks at a point before threshold beyond which the amount that the signal is amplified more than the noise decreases. Unlike degenerate internal squeezing in Fig.~\ref{fig:dIS_optimal_squeezing}, this is true when there is no loss \jam{(check the lossless case, clarify why the figure has idler loss)}. This is because the peak frequency of the nondegenerate case changes with the squeezer parameter, and the optimal sensitivity is when it is aligned with the probe frequency, but in the degenerate case, it remains at the sloshing frequency for low arm loss. 
% mention that this can be done for probe frequency, peak frequency, integral etc.
Conversely, this also demonstrates that using the sensitivity at a particular probe frequency cannot reliably find threshold, which is also true for other metrics such as peak and integrated sensitivity \jam{(is it? check this using optimisation?)}. % and instead some other metric, e.g.\ the peak or integrated sensitivity, should be used.
% Choosing the metric to judge a configuration by is a difficult task because of the innate trade-off of peak sensitivity and bandwidth. I will return to this problem later when I compare the kilohertz and broadband performances of nondegenerate internal squeezing.


\section{Comparison to existing proposals}

% The problem with making a judgement, emphasise that this result is not a clean decision, the best I can say is that they are comparable, nIS is feasible as an alternative to sWLC 
I will now compare the sensitivity of nondegenerate internal squeezing to the two existing proposals in Chapter~\ref{chp:proposals} to answer whether it is a viable, all-optical alternative to stable optomechanical filtering and whether it is more resistant to optical loss than degenerate internal squeezing. Neither of these comparisons will provide a definitive judgement on the best configuration for future detectors, but I will demonstrate that, at the very least, nondegenerate internal squeezing warrants equal consideration to these two configurations.

\subsection{All-optical versus optomechanical analogues}
\label{sec:nIS_vs_sWLC}
% ultimately: is the all-optical approach a viable alternative? yes! but sWLC is not ruled out

% plot: with data from Fig. 5 in Li --> extract the plot and don't mess with the .nb further!
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{nIS_compared_to_singleCav.pdf}
	\caption{\jam{(Purpose: show that nIS is comparable to sWLC)} \jam{(Add in curves from Li et al, 2020 Fig.~5 notebook, don't overlay.)} Nondegenerate internal squeezing compared to stable optomechanical filtering where I use the data from Fig.~5 in Ref.~\cite{} with direct permission from the authors~\cite{personalCorrespondence}. The all-optical sensitivity with realistic optical loss is worse than the optomechanical sensitivity with low mechanical loss but is comparable to it if more ideal optical losses of 75~ppm in the arms and 100~ppm in the idler are used. I use the same ratio to singularity threshold of $98\%$ as the lossless case \jam{(check what sWLC does, is $\chi_m$ or the ratio fixed?)}. \jam{I check the comparison using the single-cavity (no signal-recycling cavity) and lossless two-cavity models, which only agree if I include factors of two in the sensitivity (perhaps from the signal transfer function) and in the test mass mass (perhaps from different conventions of the reduced mass), but this does not affect the result or the conclusions \jam{(why? and why are there mistakes?)}.}}
	\label{fig:nIS_vs_sWLC}
\end{figure}

As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:modal_equivalence}, the only difference in the models of nondegenerate internal squeezing and stable optomechanical filtering is that the idler mode is optical and mechanical, respectively. This means that the idler loss is modelled by the same Langevin terms in the Hamiltonian but with different realistic loss rates between optical and mechanical loss because of the different associated technologies. Therefore, to determine whether nondegenerate internal squeezing is a viable, all-optical alternative to the optomechanical analogue, I find the optical loss required to achieve the same sensitivity as Fig.~\ref{fig:sWLC_sensitivity} which used low mechanical loss and determine whether this optical loss is realistic. 
% The key result is that I've found losses for nIS that replicate the results for sWLC: arm loss 75 ppm, idler loss 100 ppm. 
    %  Are these loss values more realistic than the thermal and mechanical constraints of sWLC? I think so, but I need back-up on this, forecasting future technological progress is hard to do rigourously or scientifically.
This is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_vs_sWLC}, where I compare the sensitivity to Fig.~5 of Ref.~\cite{Li2020}. To validate this comparison, I check that the single-cavity and lossless results agree with that reference \jam{(currently this requires two factors of two, as in Section~\ref{sec:nIS_lossless_limit}, fix this.)}. I use the same ratio to singularity threshold of $98\%$ to compare the configurations \jam{(check if $\chi_m$ changes)} and show that reducing it by $3\%$ decreases the peak but increases the bandwidth for the all-optical configuration and therefore I expect the same behaviour for the optomechanical analogue \jam{(check this?)}. In Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_vs_sWLC}, I show the sensitivity for the realistic losses from Section~\ref{sec:dIS_optical_loss} and for the lower losses of 75~ppm arm loss and 100~ppm idler loss with no idler readout rate. For these ``ideal'' losses, the peak sensitivity and bandwidth are better than the optomechanical configuration with low mechanical loss determined by $T_\text{env}=4$~K and $Q_m=8\times10^9$, but for the realistic losses they are worse \jam{(check this)}. Although predicting future technological progress is not rigorous, and so what is ideal and what is realistic is unclear, these ideal losses might be technologically possible~\cite{Zhang2020,,} and are at least as realistic \jam{(are they? what can I say here?)} as the mechanical loss required for the optomechanical analogue~\cite{,}. And because of the equivalence in Section~\ref{sec:modal_equivalence}, I predict that the tolerance to other factors, e.g.\ pump power, would be the same between the two configurations for equivalent losses. Therefore, nondegenerate internal squeezing is a viable, all-optical alternative to stable optomechanical filtering. \jam{(have I justified this conclusion? what are the limitations of this approach?)}


\subsection{Degenerate versus nondegenerate internal squeezing}
% do I need to include this? it would be nice --> above comparison is the focus though,  keep this brief, might not be a subsection worth to say
% how to quantify difference in tolerance? is nIS more resistant than dIS?

As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:nIS_tolerance_to_losses}, the tolerance to optical loss is different between nondegenerate and degenerate internal squeezing. Comparing the two configurations for the same interferometer parameters and realistic losses shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:dIS_realistic_loss}~\ref{fig:nIS_general_sens} \jam{(check that these figures compare, maybe use a different fig for nIS, and show lossless case in each)} shows that the nondegenerate case is more resilient to loss \jam{(quantify this, give total change in integrated sensitivity?)}. 
This is because of the difference between squeezing and anti-squeezing the signal and noise, discussed for detection loss in Section~\ref{sec:cavess_amp}, where loss always reduces the signal but can increase or decrease the noise depending on whether it is below or above the vacuum value, respectively. And although degenerate internal squeezing can also perform internal anti-squeezing, it is only optimal to do so when the losses are high and beyond the regime of future detectors, as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:dIS_results}. 
Therefore, as predicted in Section~\ref{sec:dIS_optical_loss}, nondegenerate internal squeezing is more resilient to optical loss than degenerate internal squeezing \jam{(can I claim this generally? what can I say that is substantive?)}. However, the sensitivity curves are not directly comparable and therefore for different parameter sets and metrics the degenerate case might be better, e.g.\ to not affect the radiation-pressure noise \jam{(why does nondegenerate affect RPN? do I also need to show the results for different parameters, e.g.\ Korobko2019?)}. %And Other considerations, such as the different tolerances to pump power, are necessary to decide between the two. 


Compared to the two configurations from Chapter~\ref{chp:proposals}, nondegenerate internal squeezing is neither definitively better nor worse, meaning that it warrants equal consideration as them \jam{(this evasive but what else can I say?)}, particularly for its relative resilience to loss. % particularly when the optical loss is high but the mechanical loss higher \jam{(I cannot directly compare these, what do I mean to say?)}.



\section{Feasibility for gravitational-wave detection}

I now return to the motivating problem of improving kilohertz gravitational-wave sensitivity to detect new astrophysical sources. I will explore the feasibility of nondegenerate internal squeezing for both kilohertz (e.g. 1--4~kHz) and broadband (e.g. 100--4000~Hz) detection. I will reinforce that nondegenerate internal squeezing warrants further investigation by showing that its sensitivity is promising for detection even without external squeezing or increased circulating power. Again, I do not aim to find the best configuration for future detectors but instead will look at nondegenerate internal squeezing's performance for the LIGO~Voyager parameter set with varied readout rates which partially characterises the possible configurations.
% mention how optimisation could be done towards either goal against a variety of metrics, list some mutrics, but leave to future work
% Also, determining the best configuration would depend on the goal, e.g.\ kilohertz versus broadband sensitivity, and the metric used, e.g.\ sensitivity peak or integral against a kernel that biases certain frequencies~\cite{}, which I leave to future work with a more detailed model. 

% stress that the goal of this thesis is not to provide a recommendation to the designers of future gravitational wave detectors of what parameters to use, that task is much harder and would require the modelling of many other effects. This section (and thesis) is only exploratory in nature, and my conclusion is that nIS warrants more study because it appears to be able to get close enough to the targets (without increasing power) and is comparable to optomechanical alternative, and more resistant to detection losses than degenerate internal squeezing (operated in the squeezing not anti-squeezing pump phase).
% directly address the vagueness with ``is this configuration useful to GW detection'', talking about a particular parameter set or the best param set possible?

\subsection{Application to kilohertz detection}

% plot: curve optimised for kilohertz

    \caption{\jam{(Purpose: talk about the sensitivity target and GW-detection feasibility)} \jam{(Add in curve with more realistic losses.

Under ideal conditions, i.e.\ $95\%$ threshold; arm and idler losses at 75 and 100~ppm, respectively; and readout rate around 500~Hz the target can be achieved for some but not all of the 1--4~kHz band. For more realistic losses, decreased squeezer parameter, and/or higher readout rate the target cannot be achieved except for sometimes at the peak frequency \jam{(be more explicit?)}. Among the losses, squeezer parameter, and readout rate, the changes in readout rate have the greatest effect \jam{(quantify change and effect, how to compare changes?)}. % and the squeezer parameter affects the low readout rate cases more \jam{(explain why)}.
    Separate from the kilohertz target, the integrated sensitivity from 100--4000~kHz also improves \jam{(quantify)}. These results have not been optimised and are without external squeezing or increased circulating power.}
    \label{fig:nIS_sens_target}
\end{figure}

% achieving target across the band looks very unlikely, but target might be achievable at a particular kilohertz frequency
I consider using nondegenerate internal squeezing to detect kilohertz gravitational waves, represented by the astrophysical target sensitivity of $\sqrt{S_h}=5\times10^{-25}\text{Hz}^{-1/2}$ at 1--4~kHz from Section~\ref{sec:GW_kilohertz_target} required to detect the post-merger signal from a typical binary neutron-star merger. In Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_sens_target}, I compare this target to the sensitivity of nondegenerate internal squeezing with the realistic and ideal loss cases from Section~\ref{sec:nIS_vs_sWLC}, the idler readout port closed, and different squeezer parameters and readout rates. Although the configuration does not achieve the target from 1--4~kHz, the results are still promising. Out of the results shown, a low readout rate of $\sim 500$~Hz, such that the bandwidth of the peak is short compared to the arm cavity free-spectral range of 37.5~kHz, achieves the best sensitivity from 1--4~kHz \jam{(why?)}. For this readout rate at $95\%$ threshold, the target is achieved for less than 1~kHz of the band \jam{(give exact values)} with ideal losses, is only achieved at the peak frequency \jam{(of what?)} for realistic losses, and is not reached at $90\%$ threshold or higher readout rates \jam{(check this)}. I have experimented with what would be necessary to achieve the target from 1--4~kHz and I found that even at $99\%$ threshold with ideal losses, increased sloshing frequency \jam{(to what?)}, and readout rate to move the peak to the middle of the band \jam{(give value)}, the target could only be met from $\sim$~1--3~kHz where the arm cavity bandwidth limits further improvement \jam{(can I say this without proof?)}. 
% note the limitations with the target (conditions on a particular EoS of the neutron star etc.)
However, this target sensitivity and frequency range are not definitive as they depend on the equation-of-state of the neutron stars which is not well understood, indeed, understanding it better is one of the goals of kilohertz detection \jam{(can I criticise this approach more?)}. And so, kilohertz improvement close to the target might be sufficient~\cite{}.
Therefore, nondegenerate internal squeezing does not meet the target sensitivity from 1--4~kHz but improves kilohertz sensitivity enough by itself that together with other improvements, such as external squeezing (injected and Caves's amplification) \jam{(quantify how much)}, it would be feasible with realistic losses, 90--95$\%$ squeezer parameter, and low readout rate \jam{(is there a problem with low readout rate?)} to achieve it for part of the band. This agrees with Ref.~\cite{Miao2018} which achieved the target from 1--4~kHz using unstable~\footnote{There is not an exact correspondence between nondegenerate internal squeezing and the unstable case, see Section~\ref{sec:modal_equivalence}, but I reference it as a similar configuration that cannot achieve the target by itself but can with other improvements.} optomechanical filtering with 10~dB injected squeezing and twice the circulating power, but I avoid increasing the circulating power as explained in Section~\ref{sec:circulating_power}. The problem of improving kilohertz sensitivity is not resolved but this all-optical configuration shows some progress towards kilohertz detection.

    % Sensitivity target of 5e-25 from 1--4 kHz.
    %   With high squeezer ratio, i.e. 95\%, and ideal losses, then target can be hit for less than 1kHz of the band. With even higher squeezer ratio, i.e 99\%, and increased omegaS to move the peak into kHz (and corresponding increased gammaR), then the target can be hit for 1--3kHz.
    %       Bottom line: nIS can achieve the sensitivity target partially across the band, with more and more ideal conditions/optimisation of omegaS and gammaR necessary to widen the range that it achieves it at.
    %       Recommending a detector design isn't the goal of my project, but I do want to say something re: the sensitivity target. Right now, it sounds like nIS can achieve it at some peak frequency (under ideal conditions) but not from 1--4kHz for a Voyager-like detector.

% \end{figure}

% kilohertz detection was the aim of the thesis but it looks like nIS might be more useful for a different purpose, set up idler readout chapter?
Although kilohertz detection motivated this work, the broadband improvement from 100--4000 Hz offered by nondegenerate internal squeezing, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_sens_target}, could be used to detect more of the sources that detectors like Advanced~LIGO currently see~\cite{} but over a broader range of frequencies. For example, to observe a binary neutron-star merger from the inspiral to post-merger remnant~\cite{}, where only the late inspiral is currently seen~\cite{}. \jam{(are there other science applications of broadband detection?)} The next generation of detectors like LIGO~Voyager aim to improve the sensitivity beyond the current Advanced LIGO sensitivity of $\sqrt{S_h}=8\times10^{-24}\text{Hz}^{-1/2}$ around 100~Hz~\cite{Martynov2018} \jam{(if I quote this sensitivity, then it should be shown in the plot)}, but Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_sens_target} shows that nondegenerate internal squeezing further improves the sensitivity from 100--1000~Hz \jam{(quantify)}, along with the kilohertz improvement above, for realistic losses, $95\%$ threshold, and readout rates below 5 Hz. Where this broadband sensitivity improvement is less than the kilohertz improvement above \jam{(quantify)} because of the trade-off between peak sensitivity and bandwidth. This improvement is feasible and promising as long as the worsened radiation-pressure noise below 50~Hz is not an issue, e.g.\ it is not for binary neutron-star mergers~\cite{} \jam{(what is it an issue for? and give a 100-1000 Hz astrophysical target?)}. Therefore, nondegenerate internal squeezing should not just be considered for kilohertz sensitivity.


To improve both kilohertz and broadband detection, nondegenerate internal squeezing is a feasible configuration for future gravitational-wave detectors and should be considered for future work. To determine the optimal parameter set for a future detector, a more detailed model with effects such as pump depletion and higher-order modes \jam{(what would these effects change?)} could be optimised against some astrophysical metric~\cite{}. For example, for a broadband detector, the sensitivity integrated against a kernel that biases achieving a target sensitivity but not going beyond it might be the appropriate metric. \jam{(should I give an equation? I want to show that I have considered this, but how much detail is sufficient?)}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Chapter summary}

In this chapter, I have applied my model of nondegenerate internal squeezing to gravitational-wave detection and found that it warrants consideration for future detectors.
Firstly, I calculated the tolerance to the realistic optical loss expected in future detectors and found that the signal readout is limited by idler loss, affected by detection loss, and that signal and arm intra-cavity losses are negligible. In particular, signal readout requires the idler readout port to be closed to reduce the idler loss. I also demonstrated that when optimising the configuration's sensitivity the metric chosen might mean that the optimal squeezer parameter is below threshold \jam{(is this worth mentioning again?)}.
Secondly, I compared nondegenerate internal squeezing to the existing and related proposals of stable optomechanical filtering and degenerate internal squeezing. I showed that the optical loss required to match the performance of the optomechanical analogue was beyond the realistic level of optical loss but would require a comparable amount of technological progress to the low mechanical loss assumed for the optomechanical analogue \jam{(is this clear? is ``realistic'' a poor choice of word?)}. Therefore, I concluded that nondegenerate internal squeezing is a viable, all-optical alternative to that configuration. I also showed that nondegenerate internal squeezing is more resilient to optical loss than the degenerate case but that their sensitivity curves are not directly comparable which makes the cases useful for different purposes, e.g.\ the nondegenerate case affects the radiation-pressure noise \jam{(have I explained why?)} but the degenerate case does not.
Finally, I considered the motivating problem of improving kilohertz sensitivity and showed that, while nondegenerate internal squeezing does not achieve the particular astrophysical target for the entire band, it improves the sensitivity enough that it feasibly would enable and increase the detections of kilohertz gravitational waves from 1--4~kHz. I also considered whether it is suited to broadband detection from 100--4000~kHz and found that it would improve the sensitivity in that band at the cost of radiation-pressure noise, making it a possible consideration for broadband detectors as well.

\jam{(Have I justified my conclusions and shown deep interpretation of the results to find the physics? I do not know what to add.)}

\chapter{Idler and combined readout schemes for nondegenerate internal squeezing}
\label{chp:idler_readout}
% only a short chapter!

% motivate by: signal readout requires the idler readout port to be closed...
% chronological does not matter, make this flow from the previous chapter --> emergence of a new possibility separate from initial interest in kilohertz sensitivity
% don't say preliminary, idler readout is characterised (threshold, stability, limits, tolerance to losses, and performance against readout rates) and give potential results for combined readout, be explicit about what steps should be taken next
In this chapter, I will explore the possibility of using the idler mode, separately or coherently combined with the signal mode, for the readout of nondegenerate internal squeezing. In the previous chapter, I have shown that loss in the idler mode, including through the readout port, limits the sensitivity of signal readout. But here, I will use this idler readout rate beneficially, as part of the measurement of the gravitational-wave signal. This is motivated by the use of idler and combined readouts for the nondegenerate OPO, see Section~\ref{sec:nOPO_combined_readout}, and emerged separately to the motivating interest of improving kilohertz sensitivity.
Firstly, I will briefly discuss my model of idler and combined readouts and how it relates to the optomechanical analogue.
% explain that I leave combined readout to future work
Secondly, I will present the initial results from this model, including the stability, threshold, and high loss limit of idler and combined readout, as well as the general behaviour of idler compared to signal readout. I will leave studying the coherently combined readout's sensitivity to future work and detail what steps could be taken next.
Thirdly, I will compare the tolerance of idler and signal readouts to realistic optical losses, pump power, and pump phase \jam{(is pump tolerance necessary or just nice characterisation, summarise the ?)}. I will show that the tolerance to signal and idler intra-cavity losses is different between the readouts but that the other losses behave similarly. \jam{(what results from pump tolerance comparison?)}
%, where the idler readout's tolerance to signal loss is particularly different.
Finally, I will consider using idler readout for broadband gravitational-wave detection, including alongside signal readout in a incoherently combined readout scheme. \jam{(add a preview of the conclusion here)}


\section{Analytic model}
% short section, is a separate section necessary?
% review idler and combined signal-idler readout from nOPO chapter

\jam{(this is a disparate collection of ideas, are they all necessary?)}
I model these alternative readout schemes by using a different quadrature or linear combination of quadratures at the photodetector, as described in Section~\ref{sec:nOPO_combined_readout}. Let the arbitrary, vacuum-normalised combination of quadratures be given by $\hat{X}_\text{com}(\psi_0,\psi_1,\psi_2)$ from Eq.~\ref{eq:Xcom_three_angles} by with $\vec{\hat X}_\text{PD}(\Omega)$ from Eq.~\ref{eq:nIS_Xpd}. By Eq.~\ref{eq:nIS_sigRO_signal_response}, there is gravitational-wave signal in every quadrature when the squeezer is on except the first signal quadrature $\hat{X}_{b,1}$ and the idler combination $-\sin(\phi)\hat{X}_{c,1}+\cos(\phi)\hat{X}_{c,2}$ for the pump phase $\phi$, meaning that $\hat{X}_\text{com}$ contains the signal unless $\psi_0=\psi_2=0$ or $\psi_2=\pi/2,\;\psi_1=\phi+\pi/2$, respectively. As the signal readout maximised the gravitational-wave signal by measuring $\hat{X}_{b,2}$, see Eq.~\ref{eq:nIS_sigRO_sens}, I will define the idler readout to also maximise the signal by measuring $\cos(\phi)\hat{X}_{c,1}+\sin(\phi)\hat{X}_{c,2}$ and will discuss the tolerance to $\phi$ later. But this might not maximise the sensitivity because it does not consider the noise.
% mode structure changes, cannot compare to two-cavity detector
When the squeezer if off, no gravitational-wave signal enters the idler mode and therefore nondegenerate internal squeezing with idler readout cannot be directly compared to the two-cavity interferometer, unlike the signal readout. Which means that I expect its noise and signal responses, and their tolerance to losses etc., to be different.
% coherent combination of mechanical and optical mode is more difficult than optical-optical where you just expose a PD to both at once?
This change in mode structure \jam{(add this to Fig.~\ref{fig:mode_diagram}?)} also means that the idler readout is not PT-symmetric in the lossless limit \jam{(check)} and its optomechanical analogue measures the mechanical mode~\cite{Li2021}. However, measuring the mechanical idler mode is more difficult than the optical idler mode~\cite{}, which is another advantage of the all-optical configuration.
% coherent vs incoherent combinations
Finally, the signal and idler readouts can be combined coherently or incoherently. Measuring $\hat{X}_\text{com}$ at the readout coherently combines the signal and idler because the signal-idler correlations appear in the measurement, see Eq.~\ref{eq:Scom_nOPO_eg}. Whereas measurements at separate signal and idler readouts incoherently combine \jam{(after the fact?)}, e.g.\ as $S_{1,1}+S_{3,3}$ \jam{(is it possible with entangled fields not to measure the correlations with simultaneous measurements?)}, but although the correlations cannot then be used to enhance sensitivity, the separate measurements can be used at different frequencies. Meaning that the sensitivity of coherently combined readout can behave differently to the separate readouts but the sensitivity of incoherently combined readout is some linear combination of the signal and idler readout curves at each frequency, e.g.\ the envelope of the two curves.


\section{Results}
% mirror chapters 4,5

I will now examine some of the immediate results for the idler and combined readouts, (1) their stability and threshold, (2) the general behaviour of idler readout, and (3) the reduction to OPOs in the high arm loss limit. This is similar to Section~\ref{sec:nIS_sigRO_results} for the signal readout.

\subsection{Stability and threshold}
% not enough for a subsection?
% stability and singularity threshold maintained (same denominator) for both readouts

The idler and combined readouts have the same stability and singularity threshold as signal readout. This follows immediately from all of the (co)variances of $\vec{\hat X}_\text{PD}(\Omega)$ having a common denominator \jam{(check this. proof?)}. This also makes physical sense, the stability of the intra-cavity fields driven by the signal and noise and the gain-loss balancing to determine threshold only depend on the coupling rates out of the interferometer, not on which quadrature or field is then measured.

\subsection{General behaviour of idler readout}

% plot: separate idler and signal readout, 
% tradeoff of bandwidth and DC peak sensitivity + interaction with RP

    \caption{\jam{(Purpose: show that idler readout is worth further investigation)} \jam{(make clear which readout rate determines Lsrc and the losses. Check what happens if signal readout rate is changed instead. Show fewer columns.)} Nondegenerate internal squeezing idler readout compared to signal readout. Idler readout appears to trade bandwidth above kilohertz for DC signal amplification and preserves or worsens the integrated sensitivity \jam{(check this)}. Idler readout appears promising from 100--1000~Hz, especially when the readout rates are comparable. For idler larger than signal readout rates \jam{(check that it is the comparison that matters)}, the difference is smaller. And for idler much smaller than signal readout rates, perhaps an incoherent, frequency-dependent readout scheme is useful, e.g.\ use idler around 100~Hz and signal around 1000~Hz. \jam{(check whether incoherent readout is possible when the modes are correlated, does measurement collapse the entanglement? I think that it does but it doesn't matter because the correlations are not used)}}
    \label{fig:nIS_general_sens_idler}
\end{figure}

% peak frequency changes with readout rate because of singularity threshold
I show the general behaviour of idler readout compared to signal readout for the configuration in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_general_sens_idler} \jam{(check and explain how the readout rates are changed, signal sets the signal-recycling cavity length?)}. The noise response of the idler has a smaller, anti-squeezed peak at the same frequency \jam{(check)} as the signal readout but has worse radiation-pressure noise which improves when the idler readout rate is increased \jam{(why?)}. The peak frequency is the same for both readouts and changes with the readout rate because it is determined by the singularity threshold frequency which they share. The signal response of the idler compared to the signal readout trades the response at and above the peak for improvement down to DC which decreases with increased idler readout rate at the same rate that the radiation-pressure noise increases \jam{(why?)}.
% The result is that the signal transfer function improvement with idler readout persists at low frequencies but radiation pressure means that there's no sensitivity improvement. 
The resulting sensitivity of the idler compared to the signal readout does not change below 10~Hz, improves from $\sim$10--1000~Hz, and worsens above 10~kHz. Using the idler readout is most beneficial when the readout rates are comparable or the idler is smaller than the signal readout rate, e.g.\ 50 and 500~Hz, respectively. \jam{(quantify by change in integrated sensitivity?)}
% section 3-B in Li 2021 has noticed this already! ``During this work, I became aware \jam{(do I need to couch this? can I just say that this agress with an existing result)} of a related result in Ref.~\cite{Li2021} for the optomechanical analogue of this configuration.''
That the idler readout improves the sensitivity around 100~Hz agrees with Ref.~\cite{Li2021} that reads out the mechanical idler mode for the optomechanical analogue.
% both readout ports are open, therefore strong loss in each mode
This suggests that an incoherent readout scheme could be viable that uses the envelope of two curves, e.g.\ with equal readout rates of 500~Hz use the idler below 4~kHz and the signal above that. This beats the Mizuno limit because that limit applies to each measurement separately but not to the incoherent combination \jam{(check)}~\cite{}. The problem with incoherently combined readout is that with both readout ports open both readout schemes experience a high amount of loss from vacuum from the other port and I have shown that idler loss limits the signal readout and will show that signal loss affects the idler readout \jam{(but might be beneficial?)}. I will address the coherently combined readout below.

\subsection{Reduction to OPOs}
% reduction to nOPO and dOPO (recovers squeezing)
% reduction to OPOs, combined reduction to dOPO

\end{figure}
\begin{figure}

	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{nIS_combinedRO_dOPO_limit.pdf}
	\caption{\jam{(Purpose: show that limit work for combined readout)} \jam{(Show only noise response. Show expected limit.

Compare this to how the nondegenerate OPO with equal signal-idler mixing recovers a degenerate OPO, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nOPO_combined_readout}.}
	\label{fig:nIS_combinedRO_dOPO_limit}
\end{figure}

In the high arm loss limit, the shot noise of idler readout reduces to that of a nondegenerate OPO between the signal-recycling mirror and a fully-reflective input test mass, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_idler_nOPO_limit}. This is the same behaviour as the signal readout in Section~\ref{sec:nOPO_reduction}. \jam{is there any more to say?}
Therefore, I expect that in the high arm loss limit the combined readout reduces to the combined readout from the same nondegenerate OPO. This is indeed true, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_combinedRO_dOPO_limit}, where the balanced $\hat X_\text{com}=\frac{1}{\sqrt2}\left(\hat X_{2,b}+\hat X_{2,c}\right)$ \jam{(check)} recovers the squeezed variance of a degenerate OPO when the signal and idler losses are symmetric \jam{(check)} as in Section~\ref{sec:nOPO_combined_readout}.
% interesting that combined nIS does not reduce to dIS, perhaps this is because the idler is not resonant in the arms
Because combined readout of a nondegenerate OPO recovers a degenerate OPO, I expected that it would make nondegenerate internal squeezing recover degenerate internal squeezing, but this is false, as shown by the anti-squeezing in the low arm loss shot noise in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_idler_nOPO_limit}. I suspect that this is because the idler is not resonant in the arms and therefore the signal and idler modes are fundamentally not symmetric which appears to be required in the OPO case \jam{(do I need to say more?)}. This should be simple enough to verify by including an idler sloshing frequency $\omega_{s,c}$ in the model, which I leave to future work.

I will not explore coherently combined readout further here, instead leaving it to future work. The next steps in characterising it are similar to what I perform below for idler readout: examine the effects of (1) realistic optical loss, (2) the two readout rates, (3) pump power (squeezing parameter), (4) pump phase, and (5) the readout angles $\psi_0,\psi_1,\psi_2$ on the signal and noise responses. %These responses will be different to the signal and idler readouts because I have not studied the effect of losses etc.\ on the covariances  
Then, I would compare it to the sensitivity targets to determine whether it is best suited to broadband or kilohertz gravitational-wave detection. Ultimately, a Weiner filter for the sensitivity could be found, i.e.\ the readout angles to maximise the sensitivity at each frequency, which would out-perform the signal, idler, and incoherently combined readouts \jam{(check)}~\cite{}, and therefore be quite valuable \jam{(is there a more scientific way to say this?)} to detection efforts.

For idler readout, signal intra-cavity loss (the signal readout port is closed for this plot) decreases the peak frequency but strongly broadens the sensitivity improvement, independently of the idler readout rate. The amount of improvement to integrated sensitivity is surprising \jam{(justify, compare to something else)} and warrants further consideration of a broadband idler readout detector \jam{(can I say anything more than ``warrants ...''?)}.}

% tolerance to losses? see problem with position of signal readout tolerance above
% decrease in peak sensitivity, large increase in bandwidth

I consider the tolerance of idler readout to optical loss using the same realistic losses and parameter set as the signal readout in Section~\ref{sec:nIS_tolerance_to_losses}. Similarly to that section, I close the signal readout port and vary the idler readout rate by changing the length of the signal-recycling cavity which also scales each of the intra-cavity losses \jam{(try changing Tsrm instead?)}. I again consider each of the detection, signal, idler, and arm losses in turn.

Firstly, as shown in Ref.~\ref{fig:nIS_idlerRO_tolerance_Rpd}, the detection loss affects the idler readout similarly to the signal readout as it uniformly worsens the sensitivity except where the noise is far from vacuum, i.e.\ when it is strongly anti-squeezed or dominated by radiation pressure, since the decrease in noise and signal response are then approximately equal. This tolerance is independent of the idler readout rate. Increasing the idler readout rate with the signal readout port closed increases the bandwidth of the amplification peak but far more slowly than the corresponding change in signal readout, e.g.\ compare the 50~kHz readout rate plots in Figs.~\ref{fig:nIS_idlerRO_tolerance_Rpd}~\ref{fig:nIS_sigRO_tolerance_Rpd} \jam{(check, quantify, explain why?)}. Like with signal readout, detection loss is able to be directly addressed by Caves's amplification which means that the realistic $\sim10\%$ loss of sensitivity away from the amplification peak \jam{(check)} can be partially mitigated \jam{(quantify)}.

% for idler and arm loss, watch out for Tlc=Tla and the change to nOPO-like behaviour, but should use the realistic losses and call this out if it can be seen
Secondly, as shown in Ref.~\ref{fig:nIS_idlerRO_tolerance_Tlb}, the signal mode intra-cavity loss affects the idler readout differently than any of the losses affected the signal readout, which is allowed because of the change in mode structure. The signal loss increases the radiation-pressure noise \jam{(why?)}, broadens the shot noise peak \jam{(check the effect on the shot noise peak, does it also decrease?)}, decreases the signal peak, but uniformly amplifies the signal response away from the peak \jam{(why?)}. The effect on the signal response is similar to loss damping a resonance except that the broadening of the resonance extends to all frequencies away from the peak \jam{(check and cite comparison)}, which I found surprising. Increasing the idler readout rate does not improve the tolerance with the greatest change being the increased shot noise peak bandwidth. This results in the sensitivity worsening at low frequencies below $\sim10$~Hz where the radiation-pressure noise dominates, but improving at all other frequencies \jam{(quantify integrated sensitivity change)}. When the signal readout port is open, the signal loss increases by 46000~ppm and the idler readout sensitivity resembles Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_general_sens_idler} with diminished peak but broad sensitivity from 10--1000~Hz. I will consider later whether opening the signal readout port could be used for improving broadband detection using the idler readout. Although, strangely, it might be useful for broadband detection, I find that idler readout is strongly affected by realistic signal loss.

Thirdly, as shown in Ref.~\ref{fig:nIS_idlerRO_tolerance_Tlc}, the idler mode intra-cavity loss decreases the idler readout's sensitivity away from the peak unlike the signal readout's tolerance to signal loss, which decreased the sensitivity at the peak in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_sigRO_tolerance_Tlb}, or to idler loss, which decreased the sensitivity everywhere but improved the radiation-pressure noise in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_sigRO_tolerance_Tlc}. Idler loss in idler readout decreases the anti-squeezing at the peak similarly for noise and signal \jam{(check)}, improves the radiation-pressure noise which is common between the readouts \jam{(explain this, is it just more loss of anti-squeezing?)}, decreases the DC signal response, and has a negligible effect on frequencies higher than the peak \jam{(quantify)}. When the idler readout rate is increased, the decreases in radiation-pressure noise and DC signal response lessen \jam{(quantify, why?)}. However, at realistic 1000~ppm loss, the effect on idler readout is negligible because it is dominated by the noise through the readout port with $T_\text{srm}=0.046>0.001$, like how realistic signal loss is negligible for signal readout.

% but high arm loss will reduce circulating power, and the sensitivity will worsen overall (I do not include the affect of these losses on the circulating power, a low loss approximation)
Finally, as shown in Ref.~\ref{fig:nIS_idlerRO_tolerance_Tla}, the arm intra-cavity loss behaves somewhat similarly to the signal loss \jam{(why?)}. The radiation-pressure noise is amplified, the shot noise peak is broadened \jam{(but decreased?)}, and the signal response peak is decreased but its bandwidth is broadened, i.e.\ the signal response is improved for frequencies away from the peak. The result is that the sensitivity is decreased at the peak and at low frequencies below $\sim10$~Hz where the radiation-pressure noise dominates but is improved everywhere else \jam{(quantify change in integrated sensitivity?)}. However, unlike signal loss, the effect of arm loss decreases with increased idler readout rate \jam{(why?)} which is similar to signal readout with increased signal readout rate in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_sigRO_tolerance_Tla}. The signal peak frequency also changes due to the change in singularity threshold frequency \jam{(check this, shouldn't the shot noise singularity now be at DC?)}. But otherwise the idler readout's tolerance is different to signal readout's, the radiation-pressure noise and signal responses are different and the change around $T_{l,a}=T_{l,c}$ is not as dramatic \jam{(why when threshold is the same? does this mean that that explanation for signal readout was wrong?)}. In either case, however, the effect of realistic arm loss is negligible \jam{(quantify)} and any broadband benefit to idler readout with high arm loss is negated by the loss in circulating power \jam{(prove this or note that I do not include this effect)}.

% although the tolerance to the different losses is different to signal readout, which is allowed because of the differet mode structure, at the realistic level of loss the arm and corresponding SRC losses are negligible and the readout is dominated by the opposide mode in the SRC and the detection loss
Therefore, idler readout is affected differently to signal readout by the losses except for detection loss, which is due to the different mode structure for how the intra-cavity fields connect to the readout. For realistic losses, arm and idler losses are negligible compared to signal loss, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_idlerRO_noise_budget}, similarly to how arm and signal losses are negligible compared to idler loss for signal readout, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_sigRO_noise_budget}, and the detection loss is the second highest loss for both. But signal loss decreases the peak and radiation-pressure noise--limited sensitivity while broadening the bandwidth of idler readout, unlike idler loss which improves the radiation-pressure noise but worsens the rest of the sensitivity of signal readout. I will consider later whether increased signal loss could be beneficial for broadband detection using the idler readout.

The result is similar to the effect of squeezer parameter on signal readout, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_sens_target} except that that plot changes the signal readout rate rather than the idler. The squeezer parameter appears to matter less the higher the idler readout rate, i.e.\ for low idler readout rates the change from 90 to $95\%$ threshold creates a significant \jam{(quantify this)} difference. \jam{(explain why, low idler readout means that the system is closer to the lossless PT-symmetric case, and maybe the effect of squeezer parameter is steeper there than the nOPO limit)}}

\end{figure}

\jam{(Is this section essential? I can show the effect of $\chi$ in the GW-application section and leave pump phase to future work?)}

I also consider how tolerant the idler readout is to changes in the pump power and phase. \jam{(how much is realistic variation for each of these)}
% mention what happens when idler readout rate is kept high and signal rate is varied, see nIS_ROs_tolerance_chi_large_idler_ROrate.pdf
For changes in the pump power, i.e.\ the squeezer parameter $\chi$, the sensitivity is only affected significantly when the idler readout rate is small compared to the signal readout rate \jam{(check this, I know that signal loss affects idler strongly)}, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_idlerRO_tolerance_chi}, a change of $4\%$ in the pump power \jam{(is this large?)} affects the sensitivity \jam{as ... when the readout rates are equal and ... the signal readout rate is zero (quantify using integrated sensitivity?)}. \jam{(What happens when the signal readout rate is zero? Check that $\chi$ matters.)} And when the idler readout rate is kept at 500~Hz and the signal readout rate is varied \jam{(over what range?)}, the effect is negligible \jam{(quantify, do I need to show another plot?)}. I do not know why low idler readout rate makes the system more sensitive to the squeezer parameter but it might be because less vacuum from the readout port enters the system and therefore more anti-squeezing can be produced \jam{(compare to signal readout, is this because of the lossless limit and the extreme PT symmetry--enhanced sensitivity?)}.
For changes in the pump phase $\phi$ away from $\pi/2$, where I fix the combination angles at the readout as $\psi_1=\psi_2=\pi/2$~\footnote{Since it is the relative phase $\psi_1-\phi$ that matters, fixing $\phi$ and varying $\psi_1$ produces the same effect.}, the sensitivity is affected significantly \jam{(quantify)}, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_idlerRO_tolerance_phi}, a change of $\pi/4$ produces a change of \jam{... in the sensitivity (check and fill this in)}. Moreover, for certain pump phases, e.g.\ $\psi_1-\phi=-\pi/4$, squeezing is seen in the shot noise \jam{(check this)}.
...
The change due to the pump phase is the same at different readout rates. 
% this is a potential/preliminary result

% idler readout transfer functions: noise indep of pump phase but noise dep on relative phase of pump to linear combination of idler quadratures

% check squeezing? MJ: variational readout can recover squeezing (different homodyne angle at different freq), RPN creates i-i covariances by itself as part of ponderomotive squeezing (from the arms?)?

% optimise the readout angle? could do for signal as well --> future work


% The latest idler readout plots:
% (Plot 1) Dashed lines are without radiation pressure. The result is that the signal transfer function improvement with idler readout persists at low frequencies but radiation pressures means that there's no sensitivity improvement. 
% (Plots 2-3) Zoom-in on peak frequency, which changes with the readout rate. This is because the singularity threshold frequency depends on the losses, although I normalise the squeezer parameter to the singularity threshold value I don't normalise the frequency axis. The singularity frequencies here are: {853, 1624, 3534, 4763} Hz (truncated at the decimal point). Plot 2 is for 95% of the squeezer parameter threshold; Plot 3 is on squeezer parameter threshold (where limited resolution means that the peak is finite). When the signal readout is turned off, the effect is smaller but non-zero.
% (Plots 4-5) Tolerance to pump power. Showing the effect of changing the ratio to threshold by plus/minus 4%. The effect appears larger at smaller idler readout rates with fixed signal readout rate (Plot 4) and negligible when idler readout is large and signal readout is varied (Plot 5). I suspect that this is due to the likeness to the lossless case with no idler readout (Li et al, 2020) where 100% threshold is dramatic compared to 90% threshold -- compared to at large readout rates where 90 and 100% threshold are largely the same. Why low signal readout does not produce the same effect is because it is further from that lossless configuration, but I am less confident about this.
% The regime that is most promising is for readout rates roughly equal, so this effect for low idler readout's is less of an issue, and it appears similar to the signal readout anyway. 
% (Plot 6) Tolerance to pump phase. Fixing the combination angle psi1=pi/2 and changing the pump phase phi from pi/2 by plus/minus pi/4. Plot 6 is labelled as "combined" but the angles are selecting idler readout only. The effect is that the sensitivity seems tolerant to pump phase, independently of the readout rates (which surprised me, recall that psi1=phi is optimal for signal but the change is small). 


\section{Idler readout for broadband gravitational-wave detection}

% idler readout also looks quite promising but demands a lot more investigation before drawing strong conclusions, need to be critical of my methodology and approach
% nondegenerate is less sensitive to losses and could potentially use idler/combined readout to get ahead

% showcase the reasons for further interest in this configuration --> comparison to signal is sufficient
% Since $\Delta$ does not affect the sensitivity as long as $\Delta \ll \omega_0$, the idler frequency can be chosen to best suit the current photodetector technology, e.g.\ photodiodes at $2 \mu\text{m}$ suffer from low quantum efficiency~\cite{} so although the signal mode might be at $2 \mu\text{m}$ for separate reasons~\cite{}, the idler wavelength can be chosen to optimise the readout.
% David Ottaway: the frequencies where the idler is improving low freq sensitivity might fit into the band of InGaaAs photodetectors where the sensitivity at 2 um can be improved (currently this is a problem i.e low Quantum efficiency of photodetectors at 2um) - Vaishali

% suggestion of incoherent readout scheme


% combined (coherent) readout is even more interesting than swapping between signal and idler readout because the correlations can be used to potentially achieve even greater sensitivity
% give a sense that this exploration is not yet finished but is quite promising

% does opening the signal readout port improve the idler readout broadband detection application?
