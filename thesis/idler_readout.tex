\chapter{Idler and combined readout schemes for nondegenerate internal squeezing}
\label{chp:idler_readout}
% only a short chapter! --> too long right now!

% motivate by: signal readout requires the idler readout port to be closed...
% chronological does not matter, make this flow from the previous chapter --> emergence of a new possibility separate from initial interest in kilohertz sensitivity
% don't say preliminary, idler readout is characterised (threshold, stability, limits, tolerance to losses, and performance against readout rates) and give potential results for combined readout, be explicit about what steps should be taken next
In this chapter, I will explore using the idler mode, separately or combined with the signal mode, for the readout of nondegenerate internal squeezing. In the previous chapter, I showed that loss in the idler mode, including through the readout port, limits the sensitivity of signal readout. But here, I will use the idler readout rate beneficially, as part of the measurement of the gravitational-wave signal. This work is motivated by the use of idler and combined readouts for the nondegenerate OPO, see Section~\ref{sec:nOPO_combined_readout}, and emerged separately to the interest in improving kilohertz sensitivity.
Firstly, I will define idler readout and how it can be combined, incoherently and coherently, with signal readout. % I will also discuss how it relate to the optomechanical analogue.
% explain that I leave combined readout to future work
Secondly, I will characterise these readouts, including the stability, threshold, and high loss limit of idler and combined readout, as well as the general behaviour of idler readout compared to signal readout. I will leave studying the coherently combined readout to future work but will detail what steps should be taken next.
Thirdly, I will compare the tolerance of idler and signal readouts to realistic optical losses, pump power, and pump phase. I will show that idler readout is dominated by signal loss, but that its tolerance to it is different to signal readout's tolerance to idler loss.  
%, where the idler readout's tolerance to signal loss is particularly different.
Finally, I will consider using idler readout for broadband gravitational-wave detection, including alongside signal readout in an incoherently combined readout scheme, and argue that it is feasible to use for a future detector and warrants further consideration.


\section{Analytic model}
\label{sec:nIS_idlerRO_model}
% short section, is a separate section necessary?
% review idler and combined signal-idler readout from nOPO chapter

I model these alternative readout schemes by using a linear combination of the signal and idler quadratures at the photodetector, as described in Section~\ref{sec:nOPO_combined_readout}. Let the arbitrary, normalised~\footnote{Such that the vacuum value of the shot noise is still one.} combination of quadratures be $\hat{X}_\text{com}(\psi_0,\psi_1,\psi_2)$ from Eq.~\ref{eq:Xcom_three_angles} with $\vec{\hat X}_\text{PD}(\Omega)$ from Eq.~\ref{eq:nIS_Xpd}. By Eq.~\ref{eq:nIS_sigRO_signal_response}, there is gravitational-wave signal in every quadrature when the squeezer is on except the first signal quadrature $\hat{X}_{b,1}$ and the idler combination $-\sin(\phi)\hat{X}_{c,1}+\cos(\phi)\hat{X}_{c,2}$ for the pump phase $\phi$, meaning that $\hat{X}_\text{com}$ contains the gravitational-wave signal unless $\psi_0=\psi_2=0$ or $\psi_2=\pi/2,\;\psi_1=\phi+\pi/2$, respectively. I defined the signal readout to maximise the gravitational-wave signal by measuring $\hat{X}_{b,2}$, see Eq.~\ref{eq:nIS_sigRO_sens}, similarly, I define the idler readout to maximise the signal by measuring $\cos(\phi)\hat{X}_{c,1}+\sin(\phi)\hat{X}_{c,2}$. I will discuss the tolerance to the combination angle $\psi_1$ later. As before, this choice might not maximise the sensitivity because it does not consider the noise.
% mode structure changes, cannot compare to two-cavity detector
When the squeezer is off, no gravitational-wave signal enters the idler mode and therefore nondegenerate internal squeezing with idler readout cannot be directly compared to the two-cavity interferometer, unlike the signal readout. Therefore, I expect the idler readout's noise and signal responses to be different to the signal readout's.
% coherent combination of mechanical and optical mode is more difficult than optical-optical where you just expose a PD to both at once?
This change in mode structure, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:mode_diagram}, also means that the idler readout is not PT-symmetric in the lossless limit \jam{(check)}. Idler readout for the optomechanical analogue measures the mechanical idler mode~\cite{liEnhancingInterferometerSensitivity2021}, however, this is more difficult than measuring the optical idler mode~\cite{}, which is an advantage of the all-optical configuration.
% coherent vs incoherent combinations

The signal and idler readouts can be combined coherently or incoherently. Firstly, measuring $\hat{X}_\text{com}$ at the photodetector \jam{(explain how? state that the configuration diagram with one photodetector is a simplification)} coherently combines the signal and idler because the signal-idler correlations appear in the measurement, see Eq.~\ref{eq:Scom_nOPO_eg}. Secondly, the measurements from separate signal and idler readouts can be incoherently combined such that the correlations do not appear~\cite{}, e.g.\ as $c_0 S_{1,1}+ c_1 S_{3,3}$~\footnote{Where the spectrum at each readout is calculated and then combined with the other, rather than the measurements being combined and then the spectrum taken.}, and the combination of signal and idler can be different at different frequencies. Therefore, the sensitivity of coherently combined readout can behave differently to the separate signal and idler readouts because of the new terms from the correlations but the sensitivity of incoherently combined readout is some linear combination of the signal and idler readout curves at each frequency, e.g.\ the envelope of the two curves.


\section{Results}
% mirror chapters 4,5

I will now examine some of the immediate results for the idler and combined readouts, (1) their stability and threshold, (2) the general behaviour of idler readout, and (3) their reduction to OPOs in the high arm loss limit. %This is similar to Section~\ref{sec:nIS_sigRO_results} for the signal readout.

\subsection{Stability and threshold}
% not enough for a subsection?
% stability and singularity threshold maintained (same denominator) for both readouts

The idler and combined readouts have the same stability and singularity threshold as signal readout. This is because all of the (co)variances of $\vec{\hat X}_\text{PD}(\Omega)$, i.e.\ all of the elements of $\text{S}_X$ from Eq.~\ref{eq:nIS_Sx}, have a common denominator \jam{(check)}. This also makes physical sense, the stability of the intra-cavity fields driven by the signal and noise \jam{(am I conflating the stability of the output field and the intra-cavity field?)} and the gain-loss balancing to determine threshold only depend on the coupling rates out of the interferometer, not on which quadrature or field is then measured.

\subsection{General behaviour of idler readout}

    \caption{\jam{(Purpose: show that idler readout is worth further investigation)} \jam{(Make clear which readout rate determines Lsrc and the losses. Check what happens if signal readout rate is changed instead.)} Nondegenerate internal squeezing idler readout compared to signal readout for different idler readout rates. The astrophysical kilohertz sensitivity target is also shown for later comparison. Idler readout trades sensitivity above and at the peak (e.g.\ 10~kHz) for sensitivity below the peak down to where the improvement in the signal DC response cancels with the amplified radiation-pressure noise (e.g.\ 10~Hz). When the idler readout rate is greater than the signal readout rate, e.g.\ 5~kHz and $0.5$~kHz, respectively, the two sensitivities are approximately equal except above 10~kHz. It might be optimal for broadband improvement to use an incoherently combined readout scheme that achieves the envelope of the two curves with a smaller idler readout rate, e.g.\ 5~Hz.
    % When the idler readout rate is larger than the signal readout rate \jam{(check that it is the comparison that matters)}, the difference between the readouts is smaller. And for idler smaller than signal readout rates, e.g.\ 5 and 500~Hz, respectively, an incoherent, frequency-dependent readout scheme is useful, e.g.\ use idler around 100~Hz and signal around 1000~Hz.

% peak frequency changes with readout rate because of singularity threshold
In Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_signal_vs_idler_ROs}, I compare the general behaviour of idler readout to signal readout \jam{(check and explain how the readout rates are changed, signal sets the signal-recycling cavity length?)}. The noise response of the idler has a peak at the same frequency but with slightly less anti-squeezing \jam{(check)} than the signal readout. The peak frequency is the same for both readouts and changes with the readout rate because it is determined by the common singularity threshold frequency. The idler has worse radiation-pressure noise than the signal \jam{(quantify)} but it improves when the idler readout rate is increased \jam{(why?)}. The signal response of the idler compared to the signal readout decreases the response at and above the peak for improvement below the peak down to DC which decreases with increased idler readout rate at the same rate that the radiation-pressure noise increases \jam{(why?)}.
% The result is that the signal transfer function improvement with idler readout persists at low frequencies but radiation pressure means that there's no sensitivity improvement. 
The resulting sensitivity of the idler compared to the signal readout is the same below 10~Hz, improves from $\sim$10--1000~Hz, and worsens above 10~kHz. The idler readout is most useful when the readout rates are comparable or the idler is smaller than the signal readout rate, e.g.\ 50 and 500~Hz, respectively. \jam{(why? quantify by change in integrated sensitivity?)}
% section 3-B in Li 2021 has noticed this already! ``During this work, I became aware \jam{(do I need to couch this? can I just say that this agress with an existing result)} of a related result in Ref.~\cite{liEnhancingInterferometerSensitivity2021} for the optomechanical analogue of this configuration.''
That the idler readout improves the sensitivity around 100~Hz agrees with Ref.~\cite{liEnhancingInterferometerSensitivity2021} that considers idler readout for the optomechanical analogue.
% both readout ports are open, therefore strong loss in each mode
An incoherent readout scheme could be viable that uses the envelope of the signal and idler sensitivity curves, e.g.\ with equal readout rates of 500~Hz it uses the idler below 4~kHz and the signal above that. This beats the Mizuno limit because that limit applies separately to each measurement but not to the incoherent combination \jam{(check)}~\cite{}. A potential problem with incoherently combined readout is that with both readout ports open both readout schemes experience a high amount of loss from the other port and I have shown that idler loss limits the signal readout. I will later address whether this prevents the incoherently combined readout from being viable at realistic loss levels. 
 % and will show that signal loss affects the idler readout \jam{(but might be beneficial?)}. 
% I will address the coherently combined readout below.

This agrees with the limits for the separate readouts and that the nondegenerate OPO with combined readout recovers a degenerate OPO, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nOPO_combined_readout}. The signal and idler readout and loss rates are symmetric.}
% 	\label{fig:nIS_combinedRO_dOPO_limit}
% \end{figure}

In the high arm loss limit, the shot noise of idler readout reduces to that of a nondegenerate OPO between the signal-recycling mirror and a fully-reflective input test mass. %, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_idler_nOPO_limit}.
This is the same behaviour as the signal readout in Section~\ref{sec:nOPO_reduction}.
Therefore, I expect that in the high arm loss limit the combined readout reduces to the combined readout from the same nondegenerate OPO. This is indeed true, as $\hat X_\text{com}$ with balanced $\psi_2=\pi/4$ \jam{(check)} recovers the squeezed variance of a degenerate OPO when the signal and idler losses are symmetric \jam{(check)} as in Section~\ref{sec:nOPO_combined_readout}.
% interesting that combined nIS does not reduce to dIS, perhaps this is because the idler is not resonant in the arms
Because combined readout of a nondegenerate OPO recovers a degenerate OPO, I thought that it might make nondegenerate internal squeezing recover degenerate internal squeezing, but this is false as the combined readout displays squeezing at some frequencies and anti-squeezing at other frequencies. I suspect that this is because the idler is not resonant in the arms and therefore the signal and idler modes are not symmetric which is required in the OPO case \jam{(can I justify this more?)}. This could be verified by making the idler resonant in the arms in the model, which I leave to future work.

I will not explore coherently combined readout further here, instead I will leave it to future work. The next steps in characterising it would be similar to what I perform below for idler readout. Firstly, examine the effects of (1) realistic optical loss, (2) the two readout rates, (3) pump power, (4) pump phase, and (5) the readout angles $\psi_0,\psi_1,\psi_2$ on the signal and noise responses. %These responses will be different to the signal and idler readouts because I have not studied the effect of losses etc.\ on the covariances  
Secondly, compare it to the astrophysical sensitivity targets to determine whether it is best suited to broadband or kilohertz gravitational-wave detection. Finally, find a Weiner filter for the sensitivity, i.e.\ the readout angles to maximise the sensitivity at each frequency, which might out-perform the signal, idler, and incoherently combined readouts \jam{(check)}~\cite{}, and therefore be of interest to detection efforts.

% tolerance to losses? see problem with position of signal readout tolerance above
% decrease in peak sensitivity, large increase in bandwidth

I consider the tolerance of idler readout to optical loss using the same realistic losses and parameter set as the signal readout in Section~\ref{sec:nIS_tolerance_to_losses}. Similarly to that section, I close the signal readout port and vary the idler readout rate by changing the length of the signal-recycling cavity which also scales each of the intra-cavity losses \jam{(try changing Tsrm instead?)}. I again consider each of the detection, signal, idler, and arm losses in turn.

\jam{(Talk about noise and signal in text but don't show them in the plots, check that the explanation is still followable.)}

Firstly, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_idlerRO_tolerance_Rpd}, the detection loss affects the idler readout similarly to the signal readout as it uniformly worsens the sensitivity except where the noise is far from vacuum, i.e.\ when it is strongly anti-squeezed or dominated by radiation pressure, since the decrease in noise and signal response are then approximately equal. This tolerance is independent of the idler readout rate. Increasing the idler readout rate with the signal readout port closed increases the bandwidth of the amplification peak but far more slowly than the corresponding change in the signal readout, e.g.\ compare the 50~kHz readout rate plots in Figs.~\ref{fig:nIS_idlerRO_tolerance_Rpd}~\ref{fig:nIS_sigRO_tolerance_Rpd} \jam{(check, quantify, explain why?)}. %Like for signal readout, detection loss can be directly addressed by Caves's amplification which means that the realistic $\sim10\%$ loss of sensitivity away from the amplification peak \jam{(check)} can be partially mitigated \jam{(quantify)} unlike the other losses.

% for idler and arm loss, watch out for Tlc=Tla and the change to nOPO-like behaviour, but should use the realistic losses and call this out if it can be seen
Secondly, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_idlerRO_tolerance_Tlb}, the signal mode intra-cavity loss affects the idler readout differently than how any of the losses affected the signal readout, which is allowed because of the change in mode structure. The signal loss increases the radiation-pressure noise \jam{(why?)}, broadens the shot noise peak \jam{(check the effect on the shot noise peak, does it also decrease?)}, and decreases the signal peak, but uniformly amplifies the signal response away from the peak \jam{(why?)}. The effect on the signal response is similar to how loss damps a harmonic oscillator resonance, lowering the peak but broadening the bandwidth, except that the broadening extends to all frequencies away from the peak \jam{(check and cite comparison)}, which I found surprising. Increasing the idler readout rate does not improve the tolerance to signal loss but does broaden the shot noise peak. The net result of signal loss is that the sensitivity worsens at the peak and at low frequencies below $\sim10$~Hz where the radiation-pressure noise dominates, but improves at all other frequencies \jam{(quantify integrated sensitivity change)}. I find that idler readout is strongly affected by realistic signal loss. When the signal readout port is open, the signal loss increases by 46000~ppm given $T_\text{SRM}=0.046$ and the idler readout sensitivity resembles Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_signal_vs_idler_ROs} with diminished peak but broad sensitivity from 10--1000~Hz. I will consider later whether purposefully opening the signal readout port could be used to improve broadband detection using idler readout. %Although, strangely, it might be useful for broadband detection, I find that idler readout is strongly affected by realistic signal loss.

Thirdly, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_idlerRO_tolerance_Tlc}, the idler mode intra-cavity loss decreases the idler readout's sensitivity away from the peak. This is unlike the signal readout's tolerance to either signal loss, which decreased the sensitivity at the peak in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_sigRO_tolerance_Tlb}, or to idler loss, which decreased the sensitivity everywhere but improved the radiation-pressure noise in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_sigRO_tolerance_Tlc}. Idler loss in idler readout decreases the anti-squeezing at the peak similarly for noise and signal \jam{(check)}, improves the radiation-pressure noise like for signal readout \jam{(why?)}, decreases the DC signal response, and has a negligible effect on frequencies higher than the peak \jam{(quantify)}. When the idler readout rate is increased, the radiation-pressure noise and DC signal response decrease less \jam{(quantify, why?)}. At realistic 1000~ppm idler loss, the effect on idler readout is negligible because it is dominated by the noise through the readout port with $T_\text{srm}=0.046>0.001$, like how realistic signal loss is negligible for signal readout.

% but high arm loss will reduce circulating power, and the sensitivity will worsen overall (I do not include the affect of these losses on the circulating power, a low loss approximation)
Finally, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_idlerRO_tolerance_Tla}, the arm intra-cavity loss affects idler readout somewhat similarly to the signal loss \jam{(why?)}. The radiation-pressure noise is amplified, the shot noise peak is broadened \jam{(but decreased?)}, and the signal response peak is decreased but its bandwidth is broadened, i.e.\ the signal response is improved for frequencies away from the peak. The result is that the sensitivity is decreased at the peak and at low frequencies below $\sim10$~Hz where the radiation-pressure noise dominates but is improved everywhere else \jam{(quantify change in integrated sensitivity?)}. However, unlike signal loss, the effect of arm loss decreases with increased idler readout rate \jam{(why?)} which is also true for signal readout with increased signal readout rate in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_sigRO_tolerance_Tla}. The signal peak frequency also changes with readout rate due to the change in singularity threshold frequency \jam{(check this, shouldn't the shot noise singularity now be at DC?)}. But otherwise, the idler readout's tolerance to arm loss is different to signal readout's, the radiation-pressure noise and signal responses are different and the change around $T_{l,a}=T_{l,c}$ is not as dramatic \jam{(why when threshold is the same? does this mean that that explanation for signal readout was wrong?)}. However, in either case, the effect of realistic arm loss is negligible \jam{(quantify)} and, in practice, any broadband benefit to idler readout with high arm loss is negated by the loss in circulating power. % \jam{(prove this or note that I do not include this effect)}.

\jam{(Have I shown more interpretation than just describing these plots?)}

% although the tolerance to the different losses is different to signal readout, which is allowed because of the differet mode structure, at the realistic level of loss the arm and corresponding SRC losses are negligible and the readout is dominated by the opposide mode in the SRC and the detection loss
Therefore, idler readout is affected differently to signal readout by the losses except for detection loss, which is due to the different mode structure for how the intra-cavity fields connect to the readout.
Although for realistic losses, arm and signal losses affect the noise negligibly compared to idler and detection loss, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_idlerRO_noise_budget}, the signal loss dominates the sensitivity because of its effect on the signal response, seen by comparing Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_idlerRO_tolerance_Tlb} to Figs.~\ref{fig:nIS_idlerRO_tolerance_Rpd}~\ref{fig:nIS_idlerRO_tolerance_Tlc}~\ref{fig:nIS_idlerRO_tolerance_Tla}. \jam{(quantify, is this clear?)}
\jam{(optomechanical analogue suggests that idler loss dominates the noise, this is what I see, so why do I say that signal loss dominates sensitivity?)}
% Signal loss decreases the peak and radiation-pressure noise--limited sensitivity while broadening the bandwidth of idler readout, unlike idler loss which improves the radiation-pressure noise but worsens the rest of the sensitivity of signal readout.
% I will consider later whether increased signal loss could be beneficial for broadband detection using the idler readout.

I do not know why low idler readout rate makes the system more sensitive to the squeezer parameter but it might be because less vacuum from the readout port enters the system and therefore more anti-squeezing can be produced \jam{(compare to signal readout, is this because of the lossless limit?)}.

% idler readout transfer functions: noise indep of pump phase but noise dep on relative phase of pump to linear combination of idler quadratures
% check squeezing? MJ: variational readout can recover squeezing (different homodyne angle at different freq), RPN creates i-i covariances by itself as part of ponderomotive squeezing (from the arms?)?
% this is a potential/preliminary result
% optimise the readout angle? could do for signal as well --> future work
For changes in the pump phase $\phi$ away from $\pi/2$, where I fix the combination angles at the readout as $\psi_1=\psi_2=\pi/2$~\footnote{Since it is the relative phase $\psi_1-\phi$ that matters, fixing $\phi$ and varying $\psi_1$ produces the same effect.}, the sensitivity is moderately affected \jam{(quantify)}. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_idlerRO_tolerance_phi}, a change of $\pi/4$ produces a change of \jam{... in the integrated sensitivity (calculate this)}, and a change of exactly $\pi/2$ means that there is no gravitational-wave signal in the readout as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:nIS_idlerRO_model} \jam{(verify this)}. This tolerance is independent of the readout rates \jam{(check)} \jam{(why does the DC signal decrease with readout rate?)}. Moreover, for some relative pump phases, e.g.\ $\psi_1-\phi=-\pi/4$, squeezing is seen in the noise where the radiation-pressure noise equals the shot noise, e.g. $\sim$~100~Hz in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_idlerRO_tolerance_phi}, due to the correlations between the idler quadratures created by the radiation pressure interaction~\footnote{This is an example of ponderomotive squeezing~\cite{} where the optomechanical interaction at the test mass squeezes the reflected light and introduces correlations between the signal quadratures, which then appear between the idler quadratures via the squeezer. \jam{(check. do I need to explain this in the background chapters?)}} \jam{(check when RP is off)} and the squeezer \jam{(check this, check also for signal readout?)}, with the squeezing peak frequency changing with the idler readout rate \jam{(why?)}. Understanding this squeezing behaviour would be part of a broader study of the coherently combined readout scheme with general pump phase and combination angles, which I leave to future work.
\jam{(Add in evidence that squeezing is ponderomotive, talk about squeezing in noise of combined signal quadratures in text. I have done some of these steps now, update this.)}
The first steps to understand this particular behaviour would be to (1) verify the result by plotting the idler-idler covariance $(\text{S}_X)_{3,4}$ for various pump phases to see when it is non-zero and to plot the idler readout's noise in the other combined idler quadrature with $\phi\mapsto\phi+\pi/2$ \jam{(check)}, (2) plot for several more phase differences $\psi_1-\phi$ to see when the squeezing is present and maximal, and (3) experiment with the readout rates and other parameters to see what controls where the squeezing appears.

% Here's evidence that the squeezing seen in the combined idler quadratures is ponderomotive:
%     (Plot 1) Combined idler quadratures. If the radiation pressure is turned off, then the squeezing vanishes.
%     (Plot 2) Combined signal quadratures. If the squeezer is turned off, then squeezing is seen which disappears if the RP is turned off.
%     Checking the covariance matrix confirms that the s-s and i-i covariances vanish with rho=0.

% The latest idler readout plots:
% (Plot 1) Dashed lines are without radiation pressure. The result is that the signal transfer function improvement with idler readout persists at low frequencies but radiation pressures means that there's no sensitivity improvement. 
% (Plots 2-3) Zoom-in on peak frequency, which changes with the readout rate. This is because the singularity threshold frequency depends on the losses, although I normalise the squeezer parameter to the singularity threshold value I don't normalise the frequency axis. The singularity frequencies here are: {853, 1624, 3534, 4763} Hz (truncated at the decimal point). Plot 2 is for 95% of the squeezer parameter threshold; Plot 3 is on squeezer parameter threshold (where limited resolution means that the peak is finite). When the signal readout is turned off, the effect is smaller but non-zero.
% (Plots 4-5) Tolerance to pump power. Showing the effect of changing the ratio to threshold by plus/minus 4%. The effect appears larger at smaller idler readout rates with fixed signal readout rate (Plot 4) and negligible when idler readout is large and signal readout is varied (Plot 5). I suspect that this is due to the likeness to the lossless case with no idler readout (Li et al, 2020) where 100% threshold is dramatic compared to 90% threshold -- compared to at large readout rates where 90 and 100% threshold are largely the same. Why low signal readout does not produce the same effect is because it is further from that lossless configuration, but I am less confident about this.
% The regime that is most promising is for readout rates roughly equal, so this effect for low idler readout's is less of an issue, and it appears similar to the signal readout anyway. 
% (Plot 6) Tolerance to pump phase. Fixing the combination angle psi1=pi/2 and changing the pump phase phi from pi/2 by plus/minus pi/4. Plot 6 is labelled as "combined" but the angles are selecting idler readout only. The effect is that the sensitivity seems tolerant to pump phase, independently of the readout rates (which surprised me, recall that psi1=phi is optimal for signal but the change is small).

I now consider the feasibility of using nondegenerate internal squeezing with idler readout for gravitational-wave detection. I will consider the kilohertz and broadband applications using the same realistic losses and parameter set as the signal readout in Section~\ref{sec:nIS_sigRO_feasibility}. 
% David Ottaway: the frequencies where the idler is improving low freq sensitivity might fit into the band of InGaAs photodetectors where the sensitivity at 2 um can be improved (currently this is a problem i.e low Quantum efficiency of photodetectors at 2um) - Vaishali
In practice, the parameter set might be different for idler readout. In this model, I have assumed that the quantum efficiency of the photodetector~\footnote{Which measures how much photocurrent is created by an incident photon at a given frequency. Low quantum efficiency means that the photocurrent created is closer to the electronic and dark noise floors and the sensitivity of the detector is worse. \jam{(check)}} is frequency independent, but in practice, this is not true and the quantum efficiency for the signal at angular frequency $\omega_0$ and idler at $\omega_0+\Delta$ can be different. Since $\Delta$ does not appear in the result in Eq.~\ref{eq:nIS_Xpd}, because I use the Interaction Picture and assume $\Delta\ll\omega_0$ \jam{(but why does it not matter physically?)}, the idler frequency can be chosen to best suit the current photodetector technology, e.g.\ current photodiodes have low quantum efficiency at $2 \mu\text{m}$~\cite{}, so with the signal mode at $2 \mu\text{m}$ for the LIGO~Voyager parameter set that I use the idler wavelength could be chosen to optimise the readout. Given current technology, this could lead to a sensitivity improvement of \jam{... (find this out)}~\cite{} which I omit from the results below.

To improve kilohertz sensitivity from 1--4~kHz, the idler readout does not appear well-suited, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_idlerRO_ideal_losses} with the signal readout port closed. These results are for 500~Hz idler readout rate, where increasing the readout rate reduces the peak \jam{(why? is this shown elsewhere?)}. The peak is narrow because the signal readout port is closed and the signal loss is low compared to Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_idlerRO_tolerance_Tlb}. The peak sensitivity does not achieve the kilohertz target from Section~\ref{sec:nIS_kHz} for realistic or ideal \jam{(why change the arm loss given the noise breakdown?)} losses \jam{(quantify)}. I experimented with what parameters would be necessary to achieve the target and found that \jam{... would be required (find this out), which is more stringent than the ideal conditions required for signal readout in Section~\ref{sec:nIS_sigRO_feasibility}}. Introducing 10~dB external squeezing does achieve the target with realistic losses, however, it is over a narrower band than the signal readout \jam{(quantify)}. Therefore, compared to the signal readout in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_sens_target}, the idler readout's kilohertz sensitivity is not as promising because it is over less of the 1--4~kHz band and cannot be achieved without external squeezing for these parameters.

% does opening the signal readout port improve the idler readout broadband detection application?
But, for broadband sensitivity from 100-1000~Hz, idler readout does appear suitable and better than the signal readout \jam{(quantify performance)}, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_signal_vs_idler_ROs}, where the signal loss from opening the signal readout port decreases the peak but broadens the bandwidth as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_idlerRO_tolerance_Tlb}. Since the signal readout was already promising for broadband detection, therefore the idler readout is worth considering for broadband detection. %, since it achieves better than $10^{-24}\text{Hz}^{-1/2}$ from 100--500~Hz with realistic loss and 50~Hz idler and 500~Hz signal readout rates \jam{(is there an astrophysical target for 100-1000~Hz?)} \jam{(can I do better?)}.
% suggestion of incoherent readout scheme
Moreover, as suggested in Section~\ref{sec:nIS_general_behaviour_idler}, an incoherently combined readout scheme could achieve the envelope of the signal and idler sensitivities in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_signal_vs_idler_ROs}, such that the idler could be used at ``low'' frequencies and the signal at ``high'' frequencies. For example, with 5~Hz idler and 500~Hz signal readout rates and realistic losses, the incoherently combined readout has at least $2\times10^{-24}\text{Hz}^{-1/2}$ sensitivity from around $\sim$~80--2500~Hz \jam{(check and can I do better?)} which is a large bandwidth \jam{(quantify)} and overcomes the loss associated with having both readout ports open although it does not achieve the kilohertz sensitivity target anywhere. \jam{(is there a problem with low readout rates?)} \jam{(experiment with low signal readout rate as well)} Since the ideal idler readout rate is low, this configuration will be sensitive to the pump power, see Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_idlerRO_tolerance_chi}, but this can be addressed by pump laser amplitude stabilisation~\cite{}.

% the sensitivity target at $\sim$~2~kHz \jam{(check)} and still have sensitivity better than $10^{-24}\text{Hz}^{-1/2}$ at 100~Hz \jam{(check)}.
% Over the band, this readout has sensitivity better than $2\times10^{-24}\text{Hz}^{-1/2}$ \jam{(can I do better?)} from $\sim$~90--3000~Hz which is a large bandwidth \jam{(quantify and watch out for logarithmic scale, do I need two values here, just give the latter)}
% Compared to the detector without squeezing, e.g. with 50~kHz signal readout rate in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_sens_target} which has good \jam{(quantify)} sensitivity around 100~Hz and would be a good candidate for a future detector \jam{(quantify and justify, cite parameter set?)}, the incoherently combined readout achieves a sensitivity below $2\times10^{-24}\text{Hz}^{-1/2}$ \jam{(can I do better?)} from $\sim$~90--3000~Hz which is a large bandwidth \jam{(quantify, watch out for logarithmic scale)} compared to $\sim$~50--1000~Hz.
% The idler readout has large bandwidth here because the signal readout causes signal loss in the idler readout.

% nondegenerate is less sensitive to losses and could potentially use idler/combined readout to get ahead
% goal of detection is the same as before
Therefore, nondegenerate internal squeezing could feasibly use idler or incoherently combined readout instead of signal readout to better improve broadband 100--4000~Hz \jam{(check range)} gravitational-wave detection, motivated by the same astrophysical applications as Section~\ref{sec:nIS_sigRO_feasibility}. But, signal readout is more useful for kilohertz 1--4~kHz detection \jam{(is there a physical explanation why?)}.
% There are also a couple of other benefits to using the idler readout in this all-optical configuration: (1) potentially increased quantum efficiency by choosing the idler frequency and (2) the relative ease of measuring the optical idler mode compared to the mechanical idler mode of the optomechanical analogue.
% give a sense that this exploration is not yet finished but is quite promising
% combined (coherent) readout is even more interesting than swapping between signal and idler readout because the correlations can be used to potentially achieve even greater sensitivity
Motivated by the performance of incoherently combined readout, exploring coherently combined readout for the possibility of greater improvement is left to future work as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:nIS_idlerRO_reduction_to_OPOs}. % with the ultimate goal of optimising the readout combination angles at each frequency against some astrophysical metric. --> this has been explained already

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Chapter summary}
% I understand idler readout's threshold, stability, limits, tolerance to losses, and performance against readout rates.
% this chapter is an additional result: idler readout might be useful for broadband detection
% be explicit somewhere about the next steps for studying the combined readout --> done

In this chapter, I have considered how measuring the idler mode instead of or along with the signal mode changes the performance of nondegenerate internal squeezing. %I have also discussed how the two readouts can be combined to achieve greater sensitivity
Firstly, I reviewed how the signal and idler at the photodetector can be combined coherently or incoherently and defined the idler readout to maximise the gravitational-wave signal response.
Secondly, I characterised idler readout's stability, threshold, high arm loss limit, and performance compared to signal readout against different readout rates. I found that all of the readouts have the same stability and threshold and that they reduce to an OPO in the high arm loss limit. Compared to signal readout, the idler readout improves lower frequency sensitivity around 100~Hz at the cost of sensitivity above the peak, i.e.\ around 10~kHz.
Thirdly, I showed that idler readout with realistic losses is limited by signal loss followed by detection loss. I also showed that it is sensitive to pump power at low idler readout rates and to pump phase independently of readout rate.
Finally, while the rest of these results applied generally to cavity-based metrology, I applied idler readout to gravitational-wave detection and showed that with realistic losses the most promising application that I considered is to use incoherently combined signal and idler readouts for broadband detection from 100--4000~Hz \jam{(check)} but that kilohertz sensitivity from 1--4~kHz is improved more by signal readout. 

\jam{(do I need to show more criticism of my methodology and approach in this chapter?)}
