% only a short chapter! --> too long right now!

% motivate by: signal readout requires the idler readout port to be closed...
% chronological does not matter, make this flow from the previous chapter --> emergence of a new possibility separate from initial interest in kilohertz sensitivity
% don't say preliminary, idler readout is characterised (threshold, stability, limits, tolerance to losses, and performance against readout rates) and give potential results for combined readout, be explicit about what steps should be taken next
In this chapter, I explore using the idler mode for the readout of nondegenerate internal squeezing. In the previous chapter, I showed that loss in the idler mode, including through the readout port, limits the sensitivity of signal readout. I now instead use the idler readout rate beneficially as part of the measurement of the gravitational-wave signal.
This work emerged during my research and is separate from the initial motivation to improve kilohertz sensitivity. %is motivated by the use of idler and combined readouts for the nondegenerate OPO, see Section~\ref{sec:nOPO_combined_readout}, and
Firstly, in Section~\ref{sec:nIS_idlerRO_model}, I define idler readout and how it can be combined, incoherently and coherently, with signal readout. % I will also discuss how it relate to the optomechanical analogue.
% explain that I leave combined readout to future work
Secondly, in Section~\ref{sec:idlerRO_initial_results}, I characterise these alternative readout schemes, including their stability, threshold, and high loss limit. I also compare the general behaviour of idler readout to signal readout. Although I leave studying coherently combined readout to future work, I detail what steps should be taken next.
Thirdly, in Section~\ref{sec:idlerRO_losses}, I find the tolerance of idler readout to realistic optical losses compared to signal readout. %I will show that idler readout is dominated by signal loss\jam{(check)}, but that its tolerance to it is different to signal readout's tolerance to idler loss.
I also find the effect of variations in the pump phase.  
%, where the idler readout's tolerance to signal loss is particularly different.
Finally, in Section~\ref{sec:idlerRO_feasibility}, I consider the feasibility of using incoherently combined signal and idler readouts for broadband gravitational-wave detection. %, and argue that it is feasible to use for a future detector and warrants further consideration.

The light can either be (i) split at a dichroic optic~\cite{} to measure the signal and idler separately or (ii) coherently combined at the same photodetector, where the ellipses represent where either readout scheme joins the main configuration. When measuring the modes separately, the quadratures of the mode can be still be coherently combined, e.g.\ the idler quadratures can be combined at angle $\psi_1$.}
    \label{fig:idler_RO_config}
\end{figure}

The idler mode can be used for measurement because the internal squeezer couples the gravitational-wave signal from the signal mode into the idler mode. Therefore, unlike signal readout, the idler readout's performance cannot be compared to when the squeezer is off because then there is no signal response. This change in mode structure also means that idler readout is not PT-symmetric in the lossless limit\jam{(check)} and, therefore, I expect different behaviour than the signal readout. The idler readout rate, previously a source of loss for the signal readout, can be used to measure the idler mode separately or coherently combined with the signal mode as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:idler_RO_config}. That measuring the idler mode simply requires detecting the light leaking out through the signal-recycling mirror is an advantage of this all-optical alternative to measuring the mechanical idler mode of stable optomechanical filtering as proposed in Ref.~\cite{liEnhancingInterferometerSensitivity2021}.

Idler and coherently combined readout, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:idler_RO_config}, use the same model as signal readout from Section~\ref{sec:nIS_model} and just combine the quadratures at the photodetector as described for the nondegenerate OPO in Section~\ref{sec:nOPO_combined_readout}. Specifically, let the quadratures of $\vec{\hat X}_\text{PD}(\Omega)$ from Eq.~\ref{eq:nIS_Xpd} be coherently combined to measure~\footnote{Here, the combination angles $\psi_0,\psi_1,\psi_2\in[0,2\pi)$ can be chosen by the phase of the local oscillator in a homodyne readout scheme for example~\cite{}.}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Xcom_three_angles}
\hat X_\text{com}(\Omega)=\begin{bsmallmatrix}\cos(\psi_2)\cos(\psi_0) & \cos(\psi_2)\sin(\psi_0) & \sin(\psi_2)\cos(\psi_1) & \sin(\psi_2)\sin(\psi_1)\end{bsmallmatrix}\cdot\vec{\hat X}_\text{PD}(\Omega).
\end{equation}
Since there is gravitational-wave signal in every quadrature except the first signal quadrature $\hat{X}_{b,1}$ and the idler combination $-\sin(\phi)\hat{X}_{c,1}+\cos(\phi)\hat{X}_{c,2}$ for the pump phase $\phi$ by Eq.~\ref{eq:nIS_sigRO_signal_response}, therefore, $\hat{X}_\text{com}$ contains the gravitational-wave signal unless $\psi_0=\psi_2=0$ or $\psi_2=\pi/2,\;\psi_1=\phi+\pi/2$ as long as the squeezer is on. 
Let the coherently combined readout be defined to measure $\hat{X}_\text{com}$ for some arbitrary combination of signal and idler that contains the gravitational-wave signal, where the readout angles $(\psi_0,\psi_1,\psi_2)$ can change with frequency.
Let the idler readout be defined to maximise the gravitational-wave signal response by measuring $\cos(\phi)\hat{X}_{c,1}+\sin(\phi)\hat{X}_{c,2}$, i.e.\ by matching $\psi_1$ to the pump phase $\phi$~\footnote{This is the idler quadrature connected to the second signal quadrature, which maximises the signal, by the squeezer.}. Like the signal readout measuring $\hat{X}_{b,2}$ in Eq.~\ref{eq:nIS_sigRO_sens}, this combination might not maximise the sensitivity because it does not consider the noise. %I will examine the effect of not measuring exactly this combination later
% I defined the signal readout to maximise the gravitational-wave signal by measuring $\hat{X}_{b,2}$, see Eq.~\ref{eq:nIS_sigRO_sens}, similarly, I define the idler readout to maximise the signal by measuring $\cos(\phi)\hat{X}_{c,1}+\sin(\phi)\hat{X}_{c,2}$. I will discuss the tolerance to the combination angle $\psi_1$ later. As before, this choice might not maximise the sensitivity because it does not consider the noise.
% I model these alternative readout schemes by using a linear combination of the signal and idler quadratures at the photodetector, as described for the nondegenerate OPO in Section~\ref{sec:nOPO_combined_readout}.
% mode structure changes, cannot compare to two-cavity detector
% When the squeezer is off, no gravitational-wave signal enters the idler mode and therefore nondegenerate internal squeezing with idler readout cannot be directly compared to the two-cavity interferometer, unlike the signal readout. Therefore, I expect the idler readout's noise and signal responses to be different to the signal readout's.
% coherent combination of mechanical and optical mode is more difficult than optical-optical where you just expose a PD to both at once?
% coherent vs incoherent combinations
Finally, incoherently combined readout uses the separate signal and idler readouts at different frequencies, which does not depend on the correlations between the signal and idler unlike the coherently combined readout as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:nOPO_combined_readout}. Therefore, the incoherently combined readout can only achieve the envelope of the separate readouts' sensitivity curves but the coherently combined readout might achieve better.
% As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:nOPO_combined_readout}, the coherently combined readout depends on correlations between the signal and idler. 

% The signal and idler readouts can be combined coherently or incoherently. Firstly, measuring $\hat{X}_\text{com}$ at the photodetector\jam{(explain how? state that the configuration diagram with one photodetector is a simplification)} coherently combines the signal and idler because the signal-idler correlations appear in the measurement, see Eq.~\ref{eq:Scom_nOPO_eg}. Secondly, the measurements from separate signal and idler readouts can be incoherently combined such that the correlations do not appear~\cite{}, e.g.\ as $c_0 S_{1,1}+ c_1 S_{3,3}$~\footnote{Where the spectrum at each readout is calculated and then combined with the other, rather than the measurements being combined and then the spectrum taken.}, and the combination of signal and idler can be different at different frequencies. Therefore, the sensitivity of coherently combined readout can behave differently to the separate signal and idler readouts because of the new terms from the correlations but the sensitivity of incoherently combined readout is some linear combination of the signal and idler readout curves at each frequency, e.g.\ the envelope of the two curves.


\section{Results}
\label{sec:idlerRO_initial_results}
% mirror chapters 4,5

I will now present some of the immediate results for the idler and combined readouts. %, (1) their stability and threshold, (2) the general behaviour of idler readout, and (3) their reduction to OPOs in the high arm loss limit.  %This is similar to Section~\ref{sec:nIS_sigRO_results} for the signal readout.
I analyse these alternative readouts using the same methodology as the signal readout in the previous two chapters. 
% 2-3 sentences of immediate results
To start with, some of the behaviour is the same as the signal readout. 
The idler and combined readouts have the same stability and singularity threshold as signal readout in Section~\ref{sec:stability_and_threshold}. This is because all of the (co)variances of the signal and idler modes at the photodetector from Eq.~\ref{eq:nIS_Sx} have a common denominator\jam{(check)}, and makes physical sense as these properties depend on the intra-cavity modes and not on which mode or quadrature is measured.  
%the stability of the intra-cavity fields driven by the signal and noise\jam{(am I conflating the stability of the output field and the intra-cavity field?)} and the gain-loss balancing to determine threshold only depend on the coupling rates out of the interferometer, not on which quadrature or field is then measured.
The high arm loss limit is also the same as signal readout in Section~\ref{sec:nOPO_reduction} as the shot noise of idler readout reduces to that of a nondegenerate OPO between the signal-recycling mirror and a fully-reflective input test mass, and the coherently, equally combined readout, i.e.\ with $\psi_2=\pi/4$, recovers a degenerate OPO\jam{(check)} as in Section~\ref{sec:nOPO_combined_readout}~\footnote{Although I thought that this readout might also make nondegenerate internal squeezing recover degenerate internal squeezing, this is not true as the noise response has squeezing and anti-squeezing at different frequencies in the same quadrature, unlike the degenerate case. I suspect that this is because the idler is not resonant in the arms and therefore the signal and idler modes are not symmetric. This could be verified by making the idler resonant in the arms, which I leave to future work.}.
 %, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_idler_nOPO_limit}.
% This is the same behaviour as the signal readout in Section~\ref{sec:nOPO_reduction}.
% Therefore, I expect that in the high arm loss limit the combined readout reduces to the combined readout from the same nondegenerate OPO. This is indeed true, as $\hat X_\text{com}$ with balanced $\psi_2=\pi/4$\jam{(check)} recovers the squeezed variance of a degenerate OPO when the signal and idler losses are symmetric\jam{(check)} as in Section~\ref{sec:nOPO_combined_readout}.
% interesting that combined nIS does not reduce to dIS, perhaps this is because the idler is not resonant in the arms
% Because combined readout of a nondegenerate OPO recovers a degenerate OPO, I thought that it might make nondegenerate internal squeezing recover degenerate internal squeezing, but this is false as the combined readout displays squeezing at some frequencies and anti-squeezing at other frequencies. I suspect that this is because the idler is not resonant in the arms and therefore the signal and idler modes are not symmetric which is required in the OPO case\jam{(can I justify this more?)}. 

I will not explore coherently combined readout further here, instead, I will leave it to future work and focus on the idler readout. The next steps to characterise the coherently combined readout would be similar to the signal and idler readouts. I would first examine the effects of realistic optical loss, the readout rates, pump power, pump phase, and the readout angles $\psi_0,\psi_1,\psi_2$ on the signal and noise responses. %These responses will be different to the signal and idler readouts because I have not studied the effect of losses etc.\ on the covariances  
% Secondly, I would compare it to the astrophysical sensitivity targets to determine whether it is best suited to broadband or kilohertz gravitational-wave detection.
Then, I would find a Weiner filter for the sensitivity, i.e.\ the readout angles to maximise the sensitivity at each frequency, which is expected to out-perform the other readouts since it can at least reduce to them~\cite{}. A similar process restricted to only combining the signal quadratures could determine the optimum readout angles for signal readout, and similarly for idler readout. Finally, I would compare this optimum sensitivity to the suitable astrophysical targets to judge the feasibility for gravitational-wave detection.

    \caption{\jam{(Check what happens if signal readout rate is changed instead.)} Nondegenerate internal squeezing idler readout compared to signal readout for the same squeezing of $95\%$ threshold. I use the same parameter set for both readouts from Tab.~\ref{tab:idler_RO_parameters} but with 500~Hz signal readout rate and 5~Hz idler readout rate by appropriately changing the signal-recycling length and respective transmissivities to adjust for the added loss with both ports open. The astrophysical kilohertz sensitivity target is shown for later comparison. Idler readout trades sensitivity above and at the peak (e.g.\ 0.5--10~kHz) for sensitivity below the peak (e.g. 50--500~Hz) down to where the improvement in the signal DC response cancels with the amplified radiation-pressure noise (e.g.\ 30~Hz). When the idler readout rate is instead greater than the signal readout rate (e.g.\ 5~kHz and $0.5$~kHz respectively) the two sensitivities are approximately equal except above 10~kHz. %It might be optimal for broadband improvement to use an incoherently combined readout scheme that achieves the envelope of the two curves with a smaller idler readout rate, e.g.\ 5~Hz.
    % When the idler readout rate is larger than the signal readout rate\jam{(check that it is the comparison that matters)}, the difference between the readouts is smaller. And for idler smaller than signal readout rates, e.g.\ 5 and 500~Hz, respectively, an incoherent, frequency-dependent readout scheme is useful, e.g.\ use idler around 100~Hz and signal around 1000~Hz.

\end{table}

Some of the behaviour is different to signal readout, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_signal_vs_idler_ROs} where I compare the general behaviour of idler readout to signal readout using a modified version of the parameter set in Tab.~\ref{tab:idler_RO_parameters}~\footnote{Here, I change the readout rates by fixing the signal transmissivity and changing the signal-recycling cavity length and idler transmissivity.}. The noise response of the idler has a peak at the same frequency but with slightly less anti-squeezing\jam{(check, why?)} than the signal readout. The peak frequency is the same for both readouts because it is determined by the common singularity threshold frequency. The idler has worse radiation-pressure noise than the signal\jam{(quantify)}\jam{(why?)}. The signal response of the idler compared to the signal readout decreases the response at and above the peak but improves it below the peak down to DC. If the idler readout rate is increased, then the DC signal response improvement diminishes at the same rate that the radiation-pressure noise increases such that the ``low'' frequency sensitivity remains the same\jam{(why?)}. 
% The result is that the signal transfer function improvement with idler readout persists at low frequencies but radiation pressure means that there's no sensitivity improvement. 
The resulting sensitivity of the idler compared to the signal readout is the same below 30~Hz, improves from $\sim$30--500~Hz, and worsens above 500~Hz as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_signal_vs_idler_ROs}. For different readout rates, the crossing frequencies change but the general behaviour remains the same: idler readout is better at ``low--middle'' frequencies and worse at ``high'' frequencies than signal readout. The squeezer parameter must be non-zero for idler readout, and increasing the squeezer parameter improves the idler sensitivity from around 50~Hz up to the peak frequency but increases the radiation-pressure noise. The idler readout is most useful when the readout rates are comparable or the idler is smaller than the signal readout rate, e.g.\ as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_signal_vs_idler_ROs}.\jam{(why? quantify by change in integrated sensitivity?)}

That the idler readout improves the sensitivity around 100~Hz agrees with Ref.~\cite{liEnhancingInterferometerSensitivity2021} that considers idler readout of the mechanical mode for the optomechanical analogue.

% tolerance to losses? see problem with position of signal readout tolerance above
% decrease in peak sensitivity, large increase in bandwidth

I consider the tolerance of idler readout to optical loss using the parameter set in Tab.~\ref{tab:idler_RO_parameters} which has a higher idler readout rate than Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_signal_vs_idler_ROs}, 500 versus 5~Hz, respectively, because closing the signal readout port reduces the loss and narrows the peak, therefore, meaning that such a low readout rate is not required~\footnote{Increasing the idler readout rate with the signal readout port closed increases the width of the peak more slowly than if the signal readout rate is increased for signal readout with the idler readout port closed\jam{(quantify)}. I do not know why this difference occurs but suspect that it is related to the decreased noise and signal peak with the idler readout in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_signal_vs_idler_ROs}.}.
% Similarly to Section~\ref{sec:nIS_tolerance_to_losses}, I close the signal readout port and vary the idler readout rate by changing the length of the signal-recycling cavity which also scales each of the intra-cavity losses\jam{(try changing Tsrm instead?)}.
Using the same methodology as the signal readout in Section~\ref{sec:nIS_tolerance_to_losses}, I consider each of the detection, signal, idler, and arm losses in turn.

Firstly, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_idlerRO_tolerance_Rpd}, the realistic detection loss affects the idler readout similarly to the signal readout as it uniformly worsens the sensitivity by $10\%$ except where the noise is far from vacuum, e.g.\ around the peak and below 3~Hz. %, i.e.\ when it is strongly anti-squeezed or dominated by radiation pressure, since the decrease in noise and signal response are then approximately equal.
This tolerance is independent of the idler readout rate. %Increasing the idler readout rate with the signal readout port closed increases the bandwidth of the amplification peak but far more slowly than the corresponding change in the signal readout, e.g.\ compare the 50~kHz readout rate plots in Figs.~\ref{fig:nIS_idlerRO_tolerance_Rpd}~\ref{fig:nIS_sigRO_tolerance_Rpd}\jam{(check, quantify, explain why?)}. %Like for signal readout, detection loss can be directly addressed by Caves's amplification which means that the realistic $\sim10\%$ loss of sensitivity away from the amplification peak\jam{(check)} can be partially mitigated\jam{(quantify)} unlike the other losses.

% for idler and arm loss, watch out for Tlc=Tla and the change to nOPO-like behaviour, but should use the realistic losses and call this out if it can be seen
Secondly, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_idlerRO_tolerance_Tlb}, the signal mode intra-cavity loss affects the idler readout differently than how any of the losses affected the signal readout, which is allowed because of the change in mode structure. The signal loss increases the radiation-pressure noise\jam{(why?)}, broadens the shot noise peak\jam{(check the effect on the shot noise peak, does it also decrease?)}, and decreases the signal peak, but uniformly amplifies the signal response away from the peak\jam{(why?)}. The effect on the signal response is similar to how loss damps a harmonic oscillator resonance, lowering the peak but broadening the bandwidth, except that the broadening extends to all frequencies away from the peak\jam{(check and cite comparison)}, which I found surprising. Increasing the idler readout rate does not improve the tolerance to signal loss but does broaden the shot noise peak. The net result of signal loss is that the sensitivity worsens at the peak and at low frequencies below $\sim10$~Hz where the radiation-pressure noise dominates, but improves at all other frequencies\jam{(quantify integrated sensitivity change)}. I find that idler readout is strongly affected by realistic signal loss. When the signal readout port is open, the signal loss increases by 46000~ppm given $T_\text{SRM}=0.046$ and the idler readout sensitivity resembles Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_signal_vs_idler_ROs} with diminished peak but broad sensitivity from 10--1000~Hz. I will consider later whether purposefully opening the signal readout port could be used to improve broadband detection using idler readout. %Although, strangely, it might be useful for broadband detection, I find that idler readout is strongly affected by realistic signal loss.

Thirdly, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_idlerRO_tolerance_Tlc}, the idler mode intra-cavity loss decreases the idler readout's sensitivity away from the peak. This is unlike the signal readout's tolerance to either signal loss, which decreased the sensitivity at the peak in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_sigRO_tolerance_Tlb}, or to idler loss, which decreased the sensitivity everywhere but improved the radiation-pressure noise in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_sigRO_tolerance_Tlc}. Idler loss in idler readout decreases the anti-squeezing at the peak similarly for noise and signal\jam{(check)}, improves the radiation-pressure noise like for signal readout\jam{(why?)}, decreases the DC signal response, and has a negligible effect on frequencies higher than the peak\jam{(quantify)}. When the idler readout rate is increased, the radiation-pressure noise and DC signal response decrease less\jam{(quantify, why?)}. However, at realistic 1000~ppm idler loss, the effect on idler readout is negligible because it is dominated by the noise through the readout port, like how realistic signal loss is negligible for signal readout.

% but high arm loss will reduce circulating power, and the sensitivity will worsen overall (I do not include the affect of these losses on the circulating power, a low loss approximation)
Finally, similarly to signal readout, realistic arm intra-cavity loss has a negligible effect on idler readout if the circulating power is fixed, e.g.\ increasing the arm loss one hundred--fold only affects the sensitivity by less than\jam{... (quantify and compare to signal readout)}. % If the arm loss is made unrealistically high, then the effect on the sensitivity is similar to the signal mode loss except that it diminishes with increased idler readout rate\jam{(why?)}, but I do not consider this behaviour.
% Finally, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_idlerRO_tolerance_Tla}, the arm intra-cavity loss affects idler readout somewhat similarly to the signal loss\jam{(why?)}. The radiation-pressure noise is amplified, the shot noise peak is broadened\jam{(but decreased?)}, and the signal response peak is decreased but its bandwidth is broadened, i.e.\ the signal response is improved for frequencies away from the peak. The result is that the sensitivity is decreased at the peak and at low frequencies below $\sim10$~Hz where the radiation-pressure noise dominates but is improved everywhere else\jam{(quantify change in integrated sensitivity?)}. However, unlike signal loss, the effect of arm loss decreases with increased idler readout rate\jam{(why?)} which is also true for signal readout with increased signal readout rate in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_sigRO_tolerance_Tla}. The signal peak frequency also changes with readout rate due to the change in singularity threshold frequency\jam{(check this, shouldn't the shot noise singularity now be at DC?)}. But otherwise, the idler readout's tolerance to arm loss is different to signal readout's, the radiation-pressure noise and signal responses are different and the change around $T_{l,a}=T_{l,c}$ is not as dramatic\jam{(why when threshold is the same? does this mean that that explanation for signal readout was wrong?)}. However, in either case, the effect of realistic arm loss is negligible\jam{(quantify)} and, in practice, any broadband benefit to idler readout with high arm loss is negated by the loss in circulating power. %\jam{(prove this or note that I do not include this effect)}.

\jam{(Have I shown more interpretation than just describing these plots?)}

% although the tolerance to the different losses is different to signal readout, which is allowed because of the differet mode structure, at the realistic level of loss the arm and corresponding SRC losses are negligible and the readout is dominated by the opposide mode in the SRC and the detection loss
Therefore, idler readout is affected differently to signal readout by some of the losses, which is due to the different mode structure, i.e.\ which losses the noise and signal encounter on their way to each readout.
For realistic losses, arm and signal losses affect the noise negligibly compared to idler and detection loss. However, the signal loss has the dominant effect on the sensitivity out of the losses because of its effect on the signal response, seen by comparing Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_idlerRO_tolerance_Tlb} to Figs.~\ref{fig:nIS_idlerRO_tolerance_Rpd}~\ref{fig:nIS_idlerRO_tolerance_Tlc}.\jam{(quantify, is this clear?)} Like the signal readout, the dominant noise above 100~Hz remains the shot noise from the readout port rather than any of the losses.
\jam{(what does the optomechanical analogue with mechanical idler readout predict?)}
% Signal loss decreases the peak and radiation-pressure noise--limited sensitivity while broadening the bandwidth of idler readout, unlike idler loss which improves the radiation-pressure noise but worsens the rest of the sensitivity of signal readout.
% I will consider later whether increased signal loss could be beneficial for broadband detection using the idler readout.

Decreasing the pump power improves the radiation-pressure noise slightly\jam{(quantify)}, decreases the sensitivity uniformly from around 50~Hz up to the peak frequency, and minimally affects the sensitivity above the peak frequency. This is because the squeezer increases the radiation-pressure noise, improves the sensitivity from around 50~Hz up to the peak frequency, and does not affect the signal or noise beyond the peak.

For a relative phase within $(-\pi/2,0)$, the noise is squeezed between 1--20~Hz.

I use the parameter set in Tab.~\ref{tab:idler_RO_parameters}.}
    \label{fig:nIS_idlerRO_tolerance_phi}
\end{figure}

I defined the idler readout to optimise the signal response by matching the readout combination angle to the pump phase, e.g.\ $\psi_1-\phi=0$, but now I consider the tolerance to changes in the relative phase $\psi_1-\phi$ away from zero, where if the relative phase reaches $\pm\pi/2$ then the signal response vanishes as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:nIS_idlerRO_model}\jam{(verify this)}.
% I consider how tolerant the idler readout is to changes in the pump phase.
% Let the combination angles be fixed as $\psi_1=\psi_2=\pi/2$ and the pump phase varied away from $\pi/2$.
As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_idlerRO_tolerance_phi}, a change of $\pi/4$ in the relative phase changes the sensitivity by less than a factor of two, and since $\pi/4$ is far larger than the realistic variation in phase~\cite{}, therefore, this tolerance justifies that the relative phase can be assumed to be zero and the signal response maximal. %This tolerance is independent of the readout rates\jam{(check)}\jam{(why does the DC signal decrease with readout rate?)}.
The sign of the relative phase does not affect the sensitivity except at ``low'' frequencies where the noise for negative relative phases is squeezed\jam{(why does the sign matter?)}, e.g.\ $\psi_1-\phi=-\pi/4$ around 5~Hz in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_idlerRO_tolerance_phi}. This is because of correlations between the idler quadratures created by the radiation pressure interaction, which is evidenced by the relevant off-diagonal terms in Eq.~\ref{eq:nIS_Sx} and the squeezing vanishing if the radiation pressure is turned off~\footnote{This is an example of ponderomotive squeezing~\cite{} where the optomechanical interaction at the test mass squeezes the reflected light and introduces correlations between the signal quadratures that appear in the idler via the squeezer. The optomechanical interaction produces squeezing because it couples the amplitude of the light, which affects the radiation pressure, to the phase of the light acquired because of the displacement of the mass~\cite{}.\jam{(check, do I need to explain this in the background chapters?)}} and that similar squeezing occurs when the signal quadratures are combined\jam{(is there more to say?)}.
% The squeezing peak frequency changes with the idler readout rate\jam{(why?)}.
This squeezing could be used in a variational readout scheme~\cite{MiaoCQC?} where the relative phase is made frequency-dependent to squeeze the radiation-pressure noise around 1--10~Hz using $\psi_1-\phi<0$ but use the optimal signal response $\psi_1-\phi=0$ above 10~Hz. Although at these frequencies below 100~Hz, quantum noise is not the dominant noise source for current gravitational-wave detectors~\cite{}, it might limit future detectors as it is the fundamental noise floor~\cite{} and therefore this scheme is worth further examination.
To determine whether this could be feasible for future detectors, the relative size of the other realistic 1--100~Hz frequency noise sources would have to be considered, e.g.\ thermal, seismic, Newtonian, and control-system noises~\cite{}.
This could form part of a broader study of the coherently combined readout scheme which I leave to future work.
% The first steps to understand this behaviour would be to (1) verify the result by plotting the idler-idler covariance $(\text{S}_X)_{3,4}$ for various pump phases to see when it is non-zero and to plot the idler readout's noise in the other combined idler quadrature with $\phi\mapsto\phi+\pi/2$\jam{(check)}, (2) plot for several more phase differences $\psi_1-\phi$ to see when the squeezing is present and maximal, and (3) experiment with the readout rates and other parameters to see what controls where the squeezing appears.

% mention what happens when idler readout rate is kept high and signal rate is varied, see nIS_ROs_tolerance_chi_large_idler_ROrate.pdf
% For changes in the pump power, i.e.\ the squeezer parameter $\chi$, the sensitivity is only affected significantly when the idler readout rate is small compared to the signal readout rate\jam{(check)}, e.g.\ a change of $4\%$ in the pump power\jam{(is this large?)} affects the sensitivity\jam{by ... when the readout rates are equal and by ... when the signal readout rate is zero (quantify using integrated sensitivity?)}.\jam{(check the effect of $\chi$)} %If the pump power varies 
% If the idler readout rate is fixed at 500~Hz and instead the signal readout rate is varied\jam{(over what range?)}, the effect is negligible\jam{(quantify, do I need to show another plot?)}.
% I do not know why low idler readout rate makes the system more sensitive to the squeezer parameter but it might be because less vacuum from the readout port enters the system and therefore more anti-squeezing can be produced\jam{(compare to signal readout, is this because of the lossless limit?)}.
% the squeezer increases the radiation-pressure noise, improves the sensitivity from around 50~Hz up to the peak frequency, and does not affect the signal or noise beyond the peak. The tolerance to pump power is independent of the idler readout rate with the signal readout port closed\jam{(why?)}, but with the signal readout port open the sensitivity change for the same change of ratio to threshold is larger but is localised to the peak frequency and decreases with increased idler readout rate, e.g.\ with 500~Hz signal readout a change of $0.04$ to threshold produces a greater sensitivity change than $0.15$ shown here around the peak\jam{(check, clarify, why?)}.
% idler readout transfer functions: noise indep of pump phase but noise dep on relative phase of pump to linear combination of idler quadratures
% check squeezing? MJ: variational readout can recover squeezing (different homodyne angle at different freq), RPN creates i-i covariances by itself as part of ponderomotive squeezing (from the arms?)?
% this is a potential/preliminary result
% optimise the readout angle? could do for signal as well --> future work

% Here's evidence that the squeezing seen in the combined idler quadratures is ponderomotive:
%     (Plot 1) Combined idler quadratures. If the radiation pressure is turned off, then the squeezing vanishes.
%     (Plot 2) Combined signal quadratures. If the squeezer is turned off, then squeezing is seen which disappears if the RP is turned off.
%     Checking the covariance matrix confirms that the s-s and i-i covariances vanish with rho=0.

% The latest idler readout plots:
% (Plot 1) Dashed lines are without radiation pressure. The result is that the signal transfer function improvement with idler readout persists at low frequencies but radiation pressures means that there's no sensitivity improvement. 
% (Plots 2-3) Zoom-in on peak frequency, which changes with the readout rate. This is because the singularity threshold frequency depends on the losses, although I normalise the squeezer parameter to the singularity threshold value I don't normalise the frequency axis. The singularity frequencies here are: {853, 1624, 3534, 4763} Hz (truncated at the decimal point). Plot 2 is for 95% of the squeezer parameter threshold; Plot 3 is on squeezer parameter threshold (where limited resolution means that the peak is finite). When the signal readout is turned off, the effect is smaller but non-zero.
% (Plots 4-5) Tolerance to pump power. Showing the effect of changing the ratio to threshold by plus/minus 4%. The effect appears larger at smaller idler readout rates with fixed signal readout rate (Plot 4) and negligible when idler readout is large and signal readout is varied (Plot 5). I suspect that this is due to the likeness to the lossless case with no idler readout (Li et al, 2020) where 100% threshold is dramatic compared to 90% threshold -- compared to at large readout rates where 90 and 100% threshold are largely the same. Why low signal readout does not produce the same effect is because it is further from that lossless configuration, but I am less confident about this.
% The regime that is most promising is for readout rates roughly equal, so this effect for low idler readout's is less of an issue, and it appears similar to the signal readout anyway. 
% (Plot 6) Tolerance to pump phase. Fixing the combination angle psi1=pi/2 and changing the pump phase phi from pi/2 by plus/minus pi/4. Plot 6 is labelled as "combined" but the angles are selecting idler readout only. The effect is that the sensitivity seems tolerant to pump phase, independently of the readout rates (which surprised me, recall that psi1=phi is optimal for signal but the change is small).

I now consider the feasibility of using the idler readout for gravitational-wave detection. By Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_signal_vs_idler_ROs}, the idler readout performs worse at kilohertz than the signal readout\jam{(why?)} and therefore I do not consider using the idler readout for improving kilohertz sensitivity~\footnote{To quantify the difference, even with the signal readout port closed, 10~dB of injected external squeezing, and realistic losses, idler readout can only achieve the target at a far narrower peak than signal readout, e.g.\ less than 10~Hz compared to around 500~Hz\jam{(check)}. Such Dirac delta--like sensitivity is not viable because the target astrophysical frequencies are not exact and the gravitational waves are predicted to change in frequency over time~\cite{}.}.
However, in my exploration of nondegenerate internal squeezing, the possibility of improving broadband sensitivity has emerged despite my initial motivation to improve kilohertz sensitivity. I argued in Section~\ref{sec:signalRO_broadband} that signal readout is already promising for 100 to 4~kHz broadband detection, and idler readout performs better from 10--1000~Hz than signal readout by Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_signal_vs_idler_ROs}~\footnote{Another benefit of idler readout is that the frequency difference $\Delta$ can be chosen to match the highest quantum efficiency photodiodes since $\Delta$ does not otherwise affect the sensitivity in Eq.~\ref{eq:nIS_Xpd} which considers the photodetector to be $100\%$ efficient. This is promising because $2 \mu\text{m}$ signal readout currently has low quantum efficiency~\cite{}.\jam{(quantify improvement)}}. %, where the signal loss from opening the signal readout port decreases the idler readout's peak but broadens its bandwidth as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_idlerRO_tolerance_Tlb}.
Moreover, an incoherently combined readout scheme could achieve the envelope of the signal and idler sensitivities in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_signal_vs_idler_ROs}, such that the idler could be used at ``low'' frequencies and the signal at ``high'' frequencies. This beats the Mizuno limit because that limit applies separately to each measurement but not to the incoherent combination\jam{(check)}~\cite{}.
For example, with 5~Hz idler and 500~Hz signal readout rates and realistic losses, the incoherently combined readout has at least $2\times10^{-24}\text{Hz}^{-1/2}$ sensitivity from around $\sim$~80--2500~Hz\jam{(check and can I do better?)} which is a large bandwidth\jam{(quantify)} and overcomes the loss associated with having both readout ports open~\footnote{This smaller idler readout rate is less tolerant to changes in the pump power\jam{(why?)}, but this can be addressed by pump laser power stabilisation~\cite{}.}.
% although it does not achieve the kilohertz sensitivity target anywhere.\jam{(is there a problem with low readout rates?)}\jam{(experiment with low signal readout rate as well)}
Therefore, nondegenerate internal squeezing could feasibly use incoherently combined readout to better improve broadband 100--4000~Hz\jam{(check range)} gravitational-wave detection, motivated by the same astrophysical applications as Section~\ref{sec:signalRO_broadband}. % and improving the existing 100~Hz sensitivity. %But, signal readout is more useful for kilohertz 1--4~kHz detection\jam{(is there a physical explanation why?)}.
Exploring coherently combined readout, including the potential for variational readout in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_idlerRO_tolerance_phi}, for the possibility of even greater improvement is left to future work as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:idlerRO_initial_results}. % with the ultimate goal of optimising the readout combination angles at each frequency against some astrophysical metric. --> this has been explained already 


% does opening the signal readout port improve the idler readout broadband detection application?
% But, for broadband sensitivity from 100-1000~Hz, idler readout does appear suitable and better than the signal readout\jam{(quantify performance)}, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_signal_vs_idler_ROs}, where the signal loss from opening the signal readout port decreases the peak but broadens the bandwidth as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_idlerRO_tolerance_Tlb}. Since the signal readout was already promising for broadband detection, therefore the idler readout is worth considering for broadband detection. %, since it achieves better than $10^{-24}\text{Hz}^{-1/2}$ from 100--500~Hz with realistic loss and 50~Hz idler and 500~Hz signal readout rates\jam{(is there an astrophysical target for 100-1000~Hz?)}\jam{(can I do better?)}.
% suggestion of incoherent readout scheme
% An incoherent readout scheme could be viable that uses the envelope of the signal and idler sensitivity curves, e.g.\ with equal readout rates of 500~Hz it uses the idler below 4~kHz and the signal above that. This beats the Mizuno limit because that limit applies separately to each measurement but not to the incoherent combination\jam{(check)}~\cite{}. A potential problem with incoherently combined readout is that with both readout ports open both readout schemes experience a high amount of loss from the other port and I have shown that idler loss limits the signal readout. I will later address whether this prevents the incoherently combined readout from being viable at realistic loss levels. 

% Since the ideal idler readout rate is low, this configuration will be sensitive to the pump power, but this can be addressed by pump laser amplitude stabilisation~\cite{}. 
% But this is an issue worth over-coming\jam{(how? laser amplitude FCS?)} because of the possible broadband sensitivity. % from idler or incoherently combined readout.

% Compared to the detector without squeezing, e.g. with 50~kHz signal readout rate in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_sens_target} which has good\jam{(quantify)} sensitivity around 100~Hz and would be a good candidate for a future detector\jam{(quantify and justify, cite parameter set?)}, the incoherently combined readout achieves a sensitivity below $2\times10^{-24}\text{Hz}^{-1/2}$\jam{(can I do better?)} from $\sim$~90--3000~Hz which is a large bandwidth\jam{(quantify, watch out for logarithmic scale)} compared to $\sim$~50--1000~Hz.
% The idler readout has large bandwidth here because the signal readout causes signal loss in the idler readout.

% nondegenerate is less sensitive to losses and could potentially use idler/combined readout to get ahead
% goal of detection is the same as before
% There are also a couple of other benefits to using the idler readout in this all-optical configuration: (1) potentially increased quantum efficiency by choosing the idler frequency and (2) the relative ease of measuring the optical idler mode compared to the mechanical idler mode of the optomechanical analogue.
% give a sense that this exploration is not yet finished but is quite promising
% combined (coherent) readout is even more interesting than swapping between signal and idler readout because the correlations can be used to potentially achieve even greater sensitivity
% Motivated by the performance of incoherently combined readout,
% , along with the rest of the configuration parameters of a more detailed model, 


% David Ottaway: the frequencies where the idler is improving low freq sensitivity might fit into the band of InGaAs photodetectors where the sensitivity at 2 um can be improved (currently this is a problem i.e low Quantum efficiency of photodetectors at 2um) - Vaishali
% In practice, the parameter set might be different for idler readout.
% In this model, I have assumed that the quantum efficiency of the photodetector~\footnote{Which measures how much photocurrent is created by an incident photon at a given frequency. Low quantum efficiency means that the photocurrent created is closer to the electronic and dark noise floors and the sensitivity of the detector is worse.\jam{(check)}} is frequency independent, but in practice, this is not true and the quantum efficiency for the signal at angular frequency $\omega_0$ and idler at $\omega_0+\Delta$ can be different. Since the frequency difference $\Delta$ does not appear in the result in Eq.~\ref{eq:nIS_Xpd}, because I use the Interaction Picture and assume $\Delta\ll\omega_0$\jam{(but why does it not matter physically?)}, the idler frequency can be chosen to best suit the photodetector technology, e.g.\ current photodiodes have low quantum efficiency at $2 \mu\text{m}$~\cite{}, so with the signal mode at $2 \mu\text{m}$ for the LIGO~Voyager parameter set that I use the idler wavelength could be chosen to optimise the readout. Given current technology, this could lead to a sensitivity improvement of\jam{... (find this out)}~\cite{} but I omit this from the results below\jam{(why?)}.

% To improve kilohertz sensitivity from 1--4~kHz, the idler readout does not appear well-suited, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_idlerRO_ideal_losses} with the signal readout port closed. These results are for 500~Hz idler readout rate, where increasing the readout rate reduces the peak\jam{(why? is this shown elsewhere?)}. The peak is narrow because the signal readout port is closed and the signal loss is low compared to Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_idlerRO_tolerance_Tlb}. The peak sensitivity does not achieve the kilohertz target from Section~\ref{sec:nIS_kHz} for realistic or ideal\jam{(why change the arm loss given the noise breakdown?)} losses\jam{(quantify)}. I experimented with what parameters would be necessary to achieve the target and found that\jam{... would be required (find this out), which is more stringent than the ideal conditions required for signal readout in Section~\ref{sec:nIS_sigRO_feasibility}}. Introducing 10~dB external squeezing does achieve the target with realistic losses, however, it is over a narrower band than the signal readout\jam{(quantify)}. Therefore, compared to the signal readout in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_sens_target}, the idler readout's kilohertz sensitivity is not as promising because it is over less of the 1--4~kHz band and cannot be achieved without external squeezing for these parameters.

\section{Chapter summary}
% I understand idler readout's threshold, stability, limits, tolerance to losses, and performance against readout rates.
% this chapter is an additional result: idler readout might be useful for broadband detection
% be explicit somewhere about the next steps for studying the combined readout --> done

In this chapter, I have considered how measuring the idler mode instead of or along with the signal mode changes the performance of nondegenerate internal squeezing. %I have also discussed how the two readouts can be combined to achieve greater sensitivity
% During my exploration of this configuration, I have found some exciting
Firstly, I reviewed how the signal and idler at the photodetector can be combined coherently or incoherently and defined the idler readout to maximise the gravitational-wave signal response.
Secondly, I characterised idler readout's stability, threshold, high arm loss limit, and performance compared to signal readout against different readout rates. I found that all of the readouts have the same stability and threshold and that they reduce to an OPO in the high arm loss limit. Compared to signal readout, the idler readout improves lower frequency sensitivity around 100~Hz at the cost of sensitivity above the peak, i.e.\ around 10~kHz.
Thirdly, I showed that idler readout with realistic losses is limited by signal loss followed by detection loss. I also showed that it is sensitive to pump power at low idler readout rates and to pump phase independently of readout rate.
Finally, while the rest of these results applied generally to cavity-based metrology, I applied idler readout to gravitational-wave detection and showed that with realistic losses the most promising application that I considered is to use incoherently combined signal and idler readouts for broadband detection from 100--4000~Hz\jam{(check)} but that kilohertz sensitivity from 1--4~kHz is improved more by signal readout. 

\jam{(do I need to show more criticism of my methodology and approach in this chapter?)}
