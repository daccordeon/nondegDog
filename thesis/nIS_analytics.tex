% chapter introduction

% combine the all-optical approach of dIS with the mode structure of sWLC
In this chapter, I present my analytic Hamiltonian model of nondegenerate internal squeezing and discuss its results.
%Nondegenerate internal squeezing is the same configuration as degenerate internal squeezing except that the squeezer is operated nondegenerately, but it is better thought of as an all-optical alternative to stable optomechanical filtering.
Firstly, in Section~\ref{sec:modal_equivalence}, I describe nondegenerate internal squeezing and how it is motivated by the existing proposals introduced in the previous chapter. Secondly, in Sections~\ref{sec:nIS_model} and~\ref{sec:nIS_sigRO_results}, I derive my model and use it to characterise the sensitivity of nondegenerate internal squeezing. %I partially verify my model by demonstrating that it obeys the expected low and high loss limits.
Finally, in Section~\ref{sec:stability_and_threshold}, I find the stability and squeezing threshold of the configuration. % that unites the different squeezing configurations in this thesis. 
% from the view of quantum optics, gravitational waves in the next chapter
This chapter is directed at understanding nondegenerate internal squeezing for general quantum metrology. In subsequent chapters, I will return to the problem of kilohertz gravitational-wave detection. % to determine whether nondegenerate internal squeezing can feasibly improve sensitivity.

The signal-recycling cavity resembles the nondegenerate OPO in Fig.~\ref{fig:OPOs_config}. Abstractly, the system consists of three coupled optical modes $\hat a,\hat b,\hat c$ through which the gravitational-wave signal is coupled and measured at the photodetector. The noise is increased but the gravitational-wave signal is amplified more so that the sensitivity improves. Optical losses are not shown.}

Nondegenerate internal squeezing consists of a nondegenerate squeezer placed inside the signal-recycling cavity of the detector in Fig.~\ref{fig:DRFPMI} as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_mode_diagram}~\cite{liBroadbandSensitivityImprovement2020}. It is the same configuration as degenerate internal squeezing except that the squeezer is operated nondegenerately -- similar to the relationship between the nondegenerate and degenerate OPOs in Section~\ref{sec:Hamiltonian_modelling}. The central idea is to anti-squeeze the noise~\footnote{I will show that the noise is amplified in all quadratures which means that ``anti-squeezing'' is ``amplifying'' here.} but amplify the signal more, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_mode_diagram}, to improve sensitivity (the signal-to-noise ratio).
As a general principle~\cite{walls_1995}, when the noise is anti-squeezed a given optical loss decreases the noise towards the vacuum value of one, but when the signal is amplified it decreases towards zero by the same ratio as when it is not amplified~\footnote{Because the loss mixes in vacuum which has noise but no signal}. Therefore, if nondegenerate internal squeezing works as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_mode_diagram}~\footnote{Which I will show to be the case.}, then the decrease in sensitivity caused by a given loss would be less than the decrease without anti-squeezing because in the latter case the noise is already at the vacuum value and does not change with the loss. This resistance to loss would increase with the amount of anti-squeezing until, in the limit, the decreases in signal and noise would be the same and the sensitivity would not change. %can't use Cavess amplifier formula here because it assumes equal gain
This motivates nondegenerate internal squeezing since it might be more resistant to optical loss than, for example, degenerate internal squeezing. % because the loss will instead decrease the noise to the vacuum value. %by the same argument as Section~\ref{sec:cavess_amp}. %However, it is better thought of as an all-optical alternative to stable optomechanical filtering, which I will show.

The \emph{abstract structure of the coupled modes} of nondegenerate internal squeezing is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_mode_diagram}. Here, while both the signal and idler modes are resonant in the signal-recycling cavity, only the signal mode $\hat b$ is resonant in the arms so that the differential arm $\hat a$ and idler $\hat c$ modes are not directly coupled. Nondegenerate internal squeezing is equivalent to stable optomechanical filtering under the mapping of the optical idler mode $\hat c$ at $\omega_0+\Delta$ and squeezer parameter $\chi$ to the mechanical idler mode $\hat{c}_m$ at $\omega_m$\jam{(is this greater than $\omega_0$?)} and optomechanical coupling $\chi_m$, respectively, in the Hamiltonian~\cite{liBroadbandSensitivityImprovement2020}. I represent this in Appendix~\ref{app:mode_structure} where I compare their mode structures. In this sense, nondegenerate internal squeezing is an all-optical analogue of the optomechanical configuration.
Moreover, the loss mechanisms in the two configurations are equivalent under the same mapping which maps intra-cavity idler optical loss to mechanical idler loss. However, in practice, the two configurations are not equivalent because of the different realistic levels of optical and mechanical loss. This motivates investigating nondegenerate internal squeezing since its loss requirements might be more realistic than the optomechanical analogue's to achieve the same sensitivity. % than the mechanical loss required for the optomechanical analogue.
%\jam{(different experimental constraints on optical loss versus mechanical loss?)}

%\jam{(Should this literature review be merged with the others?)}
% This modal equivalence~\cite{liBroadbandSensitivityImprovement2020} is the only direct mention of nondegenerate internal squeezing in the literature\jam{(that I could find, check this!)}. 
 % which I attribute to the recency~\cite{korobkoQuantumExpanderGravitationalwave2019,liBroadbandSensitivityImprovement2020} of the two existing proposals in the previous chapter which motivate it.
% In the work studying the optomechanical analogue~\cite{liBroadbandSensitivityImprovement2020,liEnhancingInterferometerSensitivity2021}, only mechanical loss is included in the model\jam{(check Li2021)} since it is the dominant source of loss, but a full understanding of the system requires all realistic optical losses to be included\jam{(quantify difference?)}. % at the realistic levels for a future detector. % -- rather than indirectly by considering realistic mechanical losses. 
% Therefore, I identify this as a gap in the literature, no work has fully characterised nondegenerate internal squeezing with realistic optical loss in every mode to determine its feasibility for detection.
% Moreover, other aspects of the system are also not known, such as its low and high loss limits and lossy threshold. I partially fill this gap in this thesis. 

% all-optical alternative
% Finally, there is an alternative route to progress, to replace the optomechanical interaction with an all-optical one and replace the mechanical loss with optical loss. This is to consider nondegenerate internal squeezing, where the internal squeezer squeezes signal and idler modes and the idler is not resonant in the arms~\footnote{So that the idler mode is not coupled to the arm cavity mode.}. 
% although nIS is closer on first inspection to dIS, the underlying structure is closer to sWLC, but both motivate it.
% equivalent mode structures, just the different noise sources
% Although it might seem closer to degenerate internal squeezing than stable optomechanical filtering, the underlying mode structure of nondegenerate internal squeezing is equivalent to the latter, by mapping the idler optical mode and squeezer parameter $\hat c, \chi$ to the mechanical mode and optomechanical coupling $\hat{c}_m, \chi_m$, respectively, in the Hamiltonian~\cite{}, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:mode_diagram}.
% Although this is only true in the case with no optical or mechanical loss, as thermal noise in $\hat{c}_m$ behaves differently to shot noise in $\hat c$~\cite{}\jam{(it does experimentally and the parameter regimes are very different in application, but the Langevin terms are the same)}, it is reasonable to predict that the lossy configurations behave similarly to each other because the abstract dynamics are the same. Therefore, nondegenerate internal squeezing might achieve the sensitivity improvement of stable optomechanical filtering but at more realistic optical loss than the mechanical loss required above.

% \section{Literature review}
% a gap in the literature, should be much shorter than the review in Section~\ref{sec:literature_review} -- maybe combine it with that one?
% cannot cite personal communication?
% claim: the modelling of this configuration has never been done as thoroughly as my work, explain why (recency of interest)

%\jam{(How to be thorough with this section?)}
% The available literature on nondegenerate internal squeezing is limited. Although nondegenerate OPOs have long been studied for tests of the EPR-paradox~\cite{Reid1989,Schori2001} and other applications~\cite{,,}, placing a nondegenerate squeezer in a coupled cavity system\jam{has only been studied in ... (I am not aware of any other mentions than liBroadbandSensitivityImprovement2020, ask the supervisors.)}. 
% Although nondegenerate internal squeezing is motivated by the two configurations in the previous chapter, those configurations have only been studied in the last few years, see Section~\ref{sec:literature_review}.\jam{(Is there direct mention of nIS in the dIS literature?)}
% The only direct mention of nondegenerate internal squeezing\jam{(that I could find, check this!)} in the literature is the brief suggestion in Ref.~\cite{liBroadbandSensitivityImprovement2020} that it is equivalent to stable optomechanical filtering in the lossless case. In that paper and subsequent work by the same authors~\cite{liEnhancingInterferometerSensitivity2021}, only mechanical loss is included in the model since it is the dominant source of loss. By the modal equivalence in Section~\ref{sec:modal_equivalence}, I predict that optical loss in the idler mode should be the dominant source of loss for nondegenerate internal squeezing but this is not known.
 % distribution of loss in applications might be far from uniform, e.g.\ how the detection loss is predicted to be higher than any of the intra-cavity losses for future gravitational-wave detectors~\cite{}.

% \subsubsection{Simplification to pair of coupled cavities}
% does this need to be in the introduction or can it wait until Chapter 3?
% single mode approximation
% \label{sec:coupled_cavity_approximation}

% \begin{figure}
%   \centering
%   % \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{}
%   \caption{Coupled cavity approximation to the interferometer in Fig.~\ref{fig:DRFPMI}. The approximation is only valid when it is below one free spectral range of the arms.}
%   \label{fig:coupled_cavity_approx}
% \end{figure}

% This is not the same as removing an arm from a Michelson interferometer, the new arm cavity mode is the differential mode of the original interferometer. 
% This simplification allows the interferometer to be understood as a pair of coupled cavities, a two-mode system, and makes clear why certain quantities, like the sloshing frequency of the two modes, should matter to the interferometer -- which is less clear when the interferometer is directly modelled.

	\label{fig:nIS_config}
\end{figure}

I model nondegenerate internal squeezing using the Hamiltonian method from Section~\ref{sec:Hamiltonian_modelling} which was also used to model the results for degenerate internal squeezing in Section~\ref{sec:dIS_results}~\cite{korobkoQuantumExpanderGravitationalwave2019} and stable optomechanical filtering in Ref.~\cite{liBroadbandSensitivityImprovement2020}. %, in particular, this model combines the nondegenerate OPO model in Section~\ref{sec:nOPO} and the ~\ref{sec:dIS_model}, respectively.
% There are no steps in this derivation that have not already appeared in this thesis\jam{(check this)}.
% This model is based on and verified against the lossless model for the optomechanical analogue in Ref.~\cite{liBroadbandSensitivityImprovement2020} which effectively couples an arm cavity mode to the nondegenerate OPO model in Section~\ref{sec:nOPO}. %, and to that model I add intra-cavity and detection losses.
%\jam{(Probably need to talk about my methodology more -- state that this derivation presented is the last of a long curve of increasing complexity (more losses, radiation pressure, pump phase, etc.) and that I have verified at each stage that the model recovers the previous model. This allowed me to also consider the impact of each subsequent addition in isolation. Moreover, I should re-emphasise that it reduces to the lossless case in Li and follows the same path as the verified models of dIS and the OPOs. The point is that this derivation is not controversial.)}
When deriving my model, my approach was to start with the lossless model for the optomechanical analogue in Ref.~\cite{liBroadbandSensitivityImprovement2020} and progressively add the complexities of optical loss in each mode, pump phase, and radiation pressure so that I could study each complication separately. At each stage, I verified that the model recovered the previous stage in the appropriate limits. For brevity, I now present the complete model.

Let the modes be labelled as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_config}. 
Here, I assume a single-mode approximation to the light in the arm cavities such that the detector in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_mode_diagram} is simplified to a three-mirror coupled cavity system between a single ``arm'' cavity, with resonant mode as the differential mode $\hat a$ of the detector, and the signal-recycling cavity~\footnote{The laser source and the power-recycling cavity are abstracted into the fixed circulating power in the arm cavity.}. This ``coupled-cavity'' approximation is common in the literature~\cite{adyaQuantumEnhancedKHz2020,liBroadbandSensitivityImprovement2020,miaoEnhancingBandwidthGravitationalWave2015}, was used in the degenerate internal squeezing model in Section~\ref{sec:dIS}~\cite{korobkoQuantumExpanderGravitationalwave2019}, and is valid below one ``free spectral range'' of the arm cavities (e.g.\ below 37.5~kHz for 4~km arms~\cite{miaoEnhancingBandwidthGravitationalWave2015}).
To the nondegenerate OPO model in Section~\ref{sec:nOPO}, I add the differential arm cavity mode $\hat a$ at carrier frequency $\omega_0$ with an intra-cavity loss port with transmissivity $T_{l,a}$ into vacuum $\hat n^L_a$, and detection loss $R_\text{PD}$ into vacuum $\hat n^L_\text{PD}$ modelled using the beamsplitter convention from Fig.~\ref{fig:beamsplitter_loss}~\footnote{I assume that the detection loss $R_\text{PD}$ is symmetric between the signal and idler.}. Let the gravitational-wave signal $h(t)$ from Section~\ref{sec:gravWaves} be coupled to the arm cavity mode by the test mass mechanical mode given by displacement $\hat x$ and momentum $\hat p$ (approximated as free-falling horizontally as explained in Section~\ref{sec:qnoise_GW_IFO}).
The \emph{Hamiltonian} of this system is $\hat H = \hat H_0 + \hat H_I + \hat H_\gamma + \hat H_\text{GW+RP}$ where~\cite{liBroadbandSensitivityImprovement2020} 
\begin{align}\label{eq:nIS_Hamiltonian}
\hat H_0 &= \hbar \omega_0 \hat a^\dag \hat a + \hbar \omega_0 \hat b^\dag \hat b+ \hbar (\omega_0+\Delta) \hat c^\dag \hat c + \hbar (2\omega_0+\Delta) \hat u^\dag \hat u\\
\hat H_I &= i\hbar\omega_s(\hat a\hat b^\dag-\hat a^\dag\hat b) + \hbar \frac{g}{2} (\hat u \hat b^\dag \hat c^\dag+\hat u^\dag \hat b \hat c) \nonumber\\
\hat H_\gamma &= i\hbar \sqrt{2}\int \biggl( \sqrt{\gamma_a}\left(\hat{a}^\dag(\Omega)\hat n^L_a(\Omega)-\hat{a}(\Omega)\hat{n}^{L\dag}_a(\Omega)\right) \nonumber\\
& \hspace*{1.55cm} + \sqrt{\gamma^b_R}\left(\hat{b}^\dag(\Omega)\hat{B}_\text{in}(\Omega)-\hat{b}(\Omega)\hat{B}_\text{in}^\dag(\Omega)\right) + \sqrt{\gamma_b}\left(\hat{b}^\dag(\Omega)\hat n^L_b(\Omega)-\hat{b}(\Omega)\hat{n}^{L\dag}_b(\Omega)\right) \nonumber \\
& \hspace*{1.55cm} + \sqrt{\gamma^c_R}\left(\hat{c}^\dag(\Omega)\hat C_\text{in}(\Omega)-\hat{c}(\Omega)\hat C_\text{in}(\Omega)\right) + \sqrt{\gamma_c}\left(\hat{c}^\dag(\Omega)\hat n^L_c(\Omega)-\hat{c}(\Omega)\hat{n}^{L\dag}_c(\Omega)\right)\biggr)\text{d}\Omega \nonumber\\
\hat H_\text{GW+RP} &= -\alpha (\hat{x}-L_\mathrm{arm}h(t))\left(\frac{\hat{a}+\hat{a}^\dag}{\sqrt{2}}\right)+\frac{1}{2\mu}\hat{p}^2.\nonumber
\end{align}
Here, $\alpha=\sqrt{\frac{2 P_\text{circ} \omega_0 \hbar}{c  L_\text{arm}}}$ is the coupling strength to the gravitational-wave signal~\cite{liBroadbandSensitivityImprovement2020}~\footnote{I use the value of $\alpha$ from Ref.~\cite{liBroadbandSensitivityImprovement2020} which is $\sqrt2$ more than the convention used in Ref.~\cite{korobkoQuantumExpanderGravitationalwave2019} for example.\jam{(I use the Li value for comparison to sWLC but this affects the feasibility of nIS, which value is correct? not sure, just cite)}}, $\mu=M/4$ is the ``reduced'' mass\jam{(explain)} of the test masses of mass $M$, and $\omega_s\approx c\sqrt{\frac{T_\text{ITM}}{4 L_\text{arm} L_\text{SRM}}}$ is an approximation of the sloshing frequency between the coupled cavities (also known as the coupled cavity pole) which holds when $\omega_s$ (e.g.\ 5~kHz) is below one free spectral range of the arm cavities (e.g.\ 37.5~kHz)~\cite{korobkoQuantumExpanderGravitationalwave2019}.
Of these terms in the Hamiltonian, $\hat H_0$ describes the decoupled optical system, $\hat H_I$ describes the interaction between the optical modes including the same nondegenerate squeezing as Section~\ref{sec:nOPO}, $\hat H_\gamma$ describes the input/output coupling through the readout and loss ports, and $\hat H_\text{GW+RP}$ describes the coupling of the arm cavity mode to the gravitational-wave signal and the evolution of the test mass mechanical mode due to radiation pressure~\footnote{A more natural formulation of $\hat H_\text{GW+RP}$ couples the gravitational-wave strain to the mirror position and the mirror position to the cavity mode, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_mode_diagram}, but the formula that I use is equivalent~\cite{bowen2015quantum}.}.
As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_config}, there is vacuum entering the system into each intra-cavity mode $\hat n^L_a, \hat n^L_b, \hat n^L_c$, at the readout port $\hat B_\text{in}, \hat C_\text{in}$, and in the detection chain $\hat n^L_\text{PD}$ (which will be included later). Only the vacuum entering the readout port was present in the lossless model in Ref.~\cite{liBroadbandSensitivityImprovement2020}.

The \emph{Heisenberg-Langevin equations-of-motion} for this system can be found using the bosonic commutation relations, the canonical commutation relation $[\hat x,\hat p]=i\hbar$, and with all other commutators zero. As in Section~\ref{sec:nOPO}, I (1) make semi-classical and no-pump-depletion approximations that are valid below threshold to simplify the pump mode $\hat u\mapsto u e^{i\phi}=2\chi/g e^{i\phi}$, (2) enter the Interaction Picture to ignore the decoupled evolution from $\hat H_0$, and (3) take fluctuating components of each operator implicitly in the notation $\delta\hat{Q}(t)\mapsto\hat{Q}$ because it does not change the equations-of-motion\jam{(is this true? it is not clear to me)}. I find the equations-of-motion to be\jam{(change notation to be clearer, e.g.\ $\gamma_{b,\text{tot}}=\gamma_{b,R}+\gamma_{b,l}$?)}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:nIS_EoM}
\begin{cases}
\dot{\hat{a}}=-\omega_s\hat{b} - \gamma_a \hat{a} + \sqrt{2\gamma_a}\hat{n}^L_a+\frac{i}{\hbar}\alpha(\hat{x}-L_\mathrm{arm}h)\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\\
\dot{\hat{b}}=\omega_s\hat{a} - i\chi e^{i\phi}\hat{c}^\dagger - \gamma^b_\mathrm{tot} \hat{b} + \sqrt{2\gamma^b_R}\hat{B}_\mathrm{in} + \sqrt{2\gamma_b}\hat{n}^L_b\\
\dot{\hat{c}}=-i\chi e^{i\phi}\hat{b}^\dagger - \gamma^c_\mathrm{tot} \hat{c} + \sqrt{2\gamma^c_R}\hat{C}_\mathrm{in} + \sqrt{2\gamma_c}\hat{n}^L_c\\
\dot{\hat{x}}=\frac{1}{\mu}\hat{p}\\
\dot{\hat{p}}=\alpha\left(\frac{\hat{a}+\hat{a}^\dag}{\sqrt{2}}\right).
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
I solve these equations in the \emph{Fourier domain}. As in Section~\ref{sec:nOPO}, let $\vec{\hat d}(\Omega)=(\hat b(\Omega), \hat b^\dag(-\Omega), \hat c(\Omega), \hat c^\dag(-\Omega))^\text{T}$, where I use the compact notation $\tilde{\delta\hat{Q}}(\Omega)\mapsto\hat{Q}(\Omega)$ for the Fourier transform of each mode, with similar signal-idler vectorisation for each signal and idler mode, e.g.\ $\vec{\hat{D}}_\text{in}(\Omega),\; \vec{\hat n}^L_d(\Omega)$~\footnote{Where the notation $d$ indicates a similar vector to $\vec{\hat d}(\Omega)$ of both quadratures of the signal and idler.}. Let $\vec h(\Omega)=\tilde h(\Omega) (1,1,0,0)^\text{T}$ (since $h(t)$ is real, $\tilde h(\Omega)=\tilde h(-\Omega)^*$), $\vec{\hat a}(\Omega)=(\hat a(\Omega), \hat a^\dag(-\Omega),0,0)^\text{T}$~\footnote{I substitute $\hat x(\Omega) = \frac{-\alpha}{\mu\Omega^2\sqrt2}\left(\hat{a}(\Omega)+\hat{a}^\dag(-\Omega)\right)$, found by Fourier transforming Eq.~\ref{eq:nIS_EoM}, in the equation for $\hat a(\Omega)$ before vectorising.}, and similarly for $\vec{\hat n}^L_a(\Omega)$.
By Fourier transforming, vectorising, and then solving the resulting linear algebraic equations for $\vec{\hat d}(\Omega)$ using a similar process to Section~\ref{sec:Hamiltonian_modelling}, I find that the signal and idler intra-cavity modes, in terms of each vacuum input and the gravitational-wave signal, are

The \emph{total quantum noise} is given by the spectral density matrix Eq.~\ref{eq:total_noise_matrix}, which simplifies, assuming uncorrelated vacuum at each loss port, to
\begin{equation}\label{eq:nIS_Sx}
\text{S}_X=\text{R}_\text{in}\text{R}_\text{in}^\dag+\text{R}^L_a{\text{R}^L_a}^\dag+\text{R}^L_b{\text{R}^L_b}^\dag+\text{R}^L_\text{PD}{\text{R}^L_\text{PD}}^\dag.
\end{equation} % same expression as dIS
The structure of $\text{S}_X$ is divided into 2-by-2 blocks of signal-signal, signal-idler, and idler-idler (co)variances as in Section~\ref{sec:nOPO} but now with terms for the radiation-pressure noise such that the variances and covariances no longer reduce to 1 and 0, respectively, when the squeezer is off. The pump phase only appears in the off-diagonal, signal-idler covariances.

The \emph{signal response} for a given quadrature is defined with respect to the signal $\tilde h(\Omega)$, not $\vec h(\Omega)$, and therefore the vector of the signal response for each signal and idler quadrature at the photodetector is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:nIS_sigRO_signal_response}
\text{T}\begin{psmallmatrix}1 \\1\\0\\0\end{psmallmatrix} = \frac{2 \beta \sqrt{1-R_\text{PD}} \omega_s}{(\gamma_a-i \Omega ) \left(\chi ^2-(\gamma^b_\text{tot}-i\Omega) (\gamma^c_\text{tot}-i\Omega)\right)-\omega_s^2 (\gamma^c_\text{tot}-i \Omega )} \begin{psmallmatrix}0 \\-\sqrt{\gamma^b_R}(\gamma^c_\text{tot}-i\Omega)\\\sqrt{\gamma^c_R}\chi\cos(\phi)\\\sqrt{\gamma^c_R}\chi\sin(\phi)\end{psmallmatrix}.
\end{equation}
Here, $\text{T}\vec h(\Omega)=\text{T}\begin{psmallmatrix}1 \\1\\0\\0\end{psmallmatrix}\tilde h(\Omega)$ gives the signal in each quadrature.
Therefore, by Eq.~\ref{eq:nIS_sigRO_signal_response}, the gravitational-wave signal is in the second signal quadrature as well as each idler quadrature when the squeezer is on ($\chi\neq0$). For simplicity and to compare to Ref.~\cite{liBroadbandSensitivityImprovement2020}, I will consider measuring the second signal quadrature, henceforth referred to as ``signal readout''. However, this is not necessarily the optimum readout of the signal quadratures since the noise might be sufficiently lower in the first quadrature to preference measuring some quadrature between the two. I will consider this and alternative readout schemes involving the idler in Chapter~\ref{chp:idler_readout}.

The quantum noise and signal responses of the signal readout scheme are, respectively, $\sqrt{(\text{S}_X)_{2,2}}$ and $\abs{\left(\text{T}\begin{psmallmatrix}1 \\1\\0\\0\end{psmallmatrix}\right)_2}$, and the \emph{sensitivity}, conventionally plotted as the noise-to-signal ratio, is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:nIS_sigRO_sens}
\sqrt{S_h} = \frac{\sqrt{(\text{S}_X)_{2,2}}}{\abs{\left(\text{T}\begin{psmallmatrix}1 \\1\\0\\0\end{psmallmatrix}\right)_2}}.
\end{equation}
% verified these results by repeating the model with 2x2 matrices and 4x4 matrices, important to mention this because it is part of the methodology
To partially validate this result, I have repeated its derivation using 2-by-2 matrices~\footnote{Which is not a physically meaningful difference, and therefore I will not present it here, but it separates the signal and idler such that the derivations are not identical.}, and will compare it to the known limits below. %in Section~\ref{sec:nOPO_reduction}.

\label{sec:nIS_lossless_limit}

I use the data from Fig.~5 in Ref.~\cite{liBroadbandSensitivityImprovement2020} with permission from the authors~\cite{xiangLiPersonalCommunication}. The noise and signal responses and sensitivity reduce to the expected lossless limit. I use the parameters in Table~\ref{tab:signal_RO_parameters} but with no losses.}
    \label{fig:nIS_lossless}
\end{figure}

To partially validate the model, I check that it reduces to the expected \emph{lossless limit} in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_lossless}.
In the lossless limit, where $\gamma_a=\gamma_b=\gamma_c=R_\text{PD}=0$, the equations-of-motion of nondegenerate internal squeezing in Eq.~\ref{eq:nIS_EoM} reduce to those of the lossless optomechanical analogue in Ref.~\cite{liBroadbandSensitivityImprovement2020}~\footnote{Compare $\hat H_I$ from Eq.~\ref{eq:sWLC_HI} to Eq.~\ref{eq:nIS_Hamiltonian} with the semi-classical approximation to the pump mode $\hat u$.}. The resulting noise and signal responses and sensitivity also reduce to this limit as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_lossless}. This limit is expected from the comparison of the mode structure of the two lossless systems discussed in Section~\ref{sec:modal_equivalence}.
% this is because of the use of alpha from Li and not Korobko 
% no losses means no antisqueezing of shot noise but yes RPN, why? threshold=0 problem?

The \emph{general behaviour of nondegenerate internal squeezing without losses} is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_lossless}. %I examine the signal and noise responses separately to understand the sensitivity.
With the squeezer off, the sensitivity curve is shaped by the radiation-pressure noise below 10~Hz and the signal response resonance at the sloshing frequency 5~kHz with bandwidth 500~Hz determined by the signal readout rate $\gamma^b_R$, as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:dIS_results}.
With the squeezer on, lossless nondegenerate internal squeezing (1) amplifies the radiation-pressure noise to dominate below 100~Hz and further amplifies it with increased squeezer parameter and (2) amplifies the signal response from DC up to the peak frequency. The peak frequency without squeezing is at the sloshing frequency but decreases with increased squeezer parameter which is related to the squeezing threshold and will be discussed later.
The signal response is amplified by the white-light cavity effect similarly to the optomechanical analogue in Section~\ref{sec:sWLC}. %, i.e.\ the resonance behaviour of the coupled cavity system is changed by introducing the idler mode\jam{(is this true? I am not sure. the signal response still falls off at the same rate so bandwidth doesn't seem to improve except by the LF amplification?)}.
The changes are not localised to the sloshing frequency, e.g.\ the radiation-pressure noise is anti-squeezed, unlike degenerate internal squeezing, because coupling to the idler mode changes the response of the detector.
% Therefore, the radiation pressure noise at ``low'' frequencies can be affected and is also anti-squeezed.\jam{(why is it amplified, happens in lossless case as well? why does the other quadrature appear now? is it worsened proportionally to the pump power?)}


% \subsubsection{General lossy behaviour}

The effect of the squeezer and the radiation pressure noise (turned off by setting $\rho=0$) on the sensitivity are shown; the squeezer anti-squeezes the noise around the peak frequency of the signal response. The losses change the slope of the radiation pressure noise around 10~Hz and also cause the signal to not be amplified down to DC compared to the lossless case in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_lossless}. The squeezer parameter is normalised to the lossy threshold which will be found later. I use the parameters in Table~\ref{tab:signal_RO_parameters}.}
	\label{fig:nIS_general_sens}
\end{figure}

% analyse typical nIS plot features before getting into different tests
The \emph{general lossy behaviour} of nondegenerate internal squeezing is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_general_sens}. 
The behaviour with losses is the same as the lossless case in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_lossless} except that (1) the shot noise is anti-squeezed around the peak frequency\jam{(why?)}, (2) the radiation-pressure noise is anti-squeezed less, and (3) the signal amplification drops off below 100~Hz and converges to the response without squeezing below 10~Hz\jam{(explain why?)}. The bandwidth of the signal amplification is determined by the losses and therefore does not extend to DC with losses present\jam{(check. why?)}. The peak frequency around which the signal and shot noise are amplified is determined by the squeezer parameter, sloshing frequency, and loss rates.
Like the signal, the shot noise is also anti-squeezed around the peak frequency because the internal squeezer affects both the signal and noise. %, but the noise is not anti-squeezed in the lossless limit because\jam{... (why? I do not know.)}.
Inspecting the limit of smaller and smaller losses confirms that the shot noise peak decreases until it vanishes in the lossless limit as expected by analogy to the optomechanical configuration~\cite{liBroadbandSensitivityImprovement2020}.
% With the squeezer turned on, (1) the shot noise is anti-squeezed around the peak frequency determined by the squeezer parameter, sloshing frequency, and loss rates; (2) the radiation-pressure noise is anti-squeezed to now dominate below 100~Hz; and (3) the signal is amplified around the same frequency as the shot noise and at frequencies down to 10~Hz, below which it converges to the value without squeezing due to losses. 
Overall, the squeezer now improves sensitivity from around 40--3000~Hz and worsens it outside that band except above 10~kHz where the sensitivity is the same without squeezing. This is largely the same behaviour as the lossless case, but I will more closely examine the effects of each loss in the next chapter.
These quoted frequencies are specific to this parameter set but the general performance is the same: nondegenerate internal squeezing improves sensitivity at some broad range of ``middle'' frequencies at the cost of ``low'' frequency sensitivity. 
% Some of these effects will be explained later, e.g.\ the frequency around which the shot noise and the signal peak are amplified is determined by the threshold of the system, but some of these results can be explained immediately.
 % and the effect of losses will be left until I consider gravitational-wave detection feasibility.
% changing the signal response via the white-light cavity effect?
% why aren't the changes local to the sloshing frequency, like dIS?

% The changes are not localised to the sloshing frequency unlike degenerate internal squeezing in Section~\ref{sec:dIS_results}\jam{(check this, shouldn't this mean that they are still expected around the coupling frequencies?)}. 
%In the simple explanation of the signal-recycling cavity reflecting the light back into the arms to experience the gravitational wave more, the addition of the idler mode, which is not directly coupled to the arms or measured, somehow\jam{(how/why? this is wishy-washy)}.
% why does radiation pressure noise worsen?
% ~\footnote{I only talk about the radiation pressure noise where it is dominant, i.e.\ at ``low'' frequencies below the Standard Quantum Limit\jam{(is this necessary to say?)}}

% To understand how the radiation pressure noise is affected, I consider how it appears in each of the contributions to the total quantum noise, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_sigRO_noise_budget}. The radiation pressure noise appears in the contribution from the readout port and each intra-cavity loss port because these noises are coupled indirectly to the arm mode, unlike the detection loss which therefore has only shot noise. In particular, opening the idler readout port introduces more vacuum and turning the squeezer on indirectly couples the idler mode and this noise into the signal readout, which is why radiation pressure noise worsens by turning the squeezer on even when there are no losses\jam{(check this)}, which will be shown later in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_lossless}.\jam{(why is the shot noise not amplified at LF?)}
% This is because the radiation pressure noise, with the gravitational-wave signal, enters the measured, second signal quadrature after the input test mass. Having already seen the arm cavity loss, it gets added here to each of the noises that travel through the signal mode\jam{(what am I trying to say?)}. It is then anti-squeezed\jam{(check this)} and read out.

% explain the effect of each parameter? (except leave tolerance to losses to science case chapter)
% in terms of the configuration parameters rather than derived parameters such as the sloshing frequency and readout rates
The \emph{effect of each configuration parameter} is similar to the effect on the interferometer without squeezing discussed in Sections~\ref{sec:intro_IFO} and~\ref{sec:dIS_results}. To summarise, increasing the circulating power in the arms increases the signal response at all frequencies via $\beta$ in Eq.~\ref{eq:nIS_sigRO_signal_response}. Increasing the arm length increases the same factor $\beta$ as the power but also decreases the bandwidth of the signal response and the sloshing frequency which determines the peak. The sloshing frequency also decreases with decreased input test mass transmission and longer signal-recycling cavities. Increasing the signal-recycling length decreases the bandwidth of the signal peak~\footnote{The arm cavity bandwidth gives the overall shape of the signal response but the signal-recycling cavity bandwidth gives the width of the peak at the sloshing frequency.}, which is also decreased by decreased signal-recycling mirror transmission. The radiation-pressure noise increases with lighter test masses and increased pump power. Finally, increased pump power also increases the peak shot noise and signal amplification, and the pump phase does not affect signal readout.

% \subsection{Reduction to known systems}
% show that this follows from the EoM but can be verified by looking at the plots
% I predict the behaviour by taking the limits of the equations-of-motion in Eq.~\ref{eq:nIS_EoM} and verify it by examining the plots of the noise and signal responses.

% \subsubsection{High arm loss limit}
\label{sec:nOPO_reduction}

% 	\label{fig:nIS_signal_nOPO_limit}
% \end{figure}

% full 4x4 matrix agrees, not just variance 1,1
% give best explanation of ITM T=0, but can admit that while the maths is clear the physics is not obvious -- potentially requires more thought
To further validate the model, I check that it reduces to the expected limit when the arm loss is taken to infinity. 
In the \emph{high arm loss limit}, $\gamma_a\rightarrow\infty$, the equations-of-motion of nondegenerate internal squeezing in Eq.~\ref{eq:nIS_EoM} reduce to those in Eq.~\ref{eq:nOPO_EoM} for a nondegenerate OPO between the signal-recycling mirror and a fully-reflective input test mass.
I have verified this limit by checking that each of the terms of the shot noise matrix $\text{S}_X|_{\rho=0}$ from Eq.~\ref{eq:nIS_Sx} reduces to the OPO value~\cite{schoriNarrowbandFrequencyTunable2002}~\footnote{Moreover, I have checked that a similar limit holds for the model of degenerate internal squeezing in Section~\ref{sec:dIS} that reduces to a degenerate OPO with the input test mass fully reflective.}.\jam{(check if the QRPN vanishes)}
%, see Section~\ref{sec:dIS_optical_loss}, where the explanation for why the mirror is fully reflective is the same as that case. 
% therefore mystery of the idler loss carries over: idler loss cannot be zero
Although I expected physically that the input test mass would instead become another loss port with its original transmissivity, this behaviour can be explained as in the limit the equation-of-motion for the fluctuating component becomes $\dot{\delta\hat a}\approx -\gamma_a \delta\hat a$ which quickly decays, and, therefore, any vacuum fluctuations $\delta\hat n^L_a$ cannot couple to $\delta\hat b$. However, I suspect that this is a false consequence of the single-mode approximation and that if a ``transfer matrix'' approach (e.g.\ in Refs.~\cite{korobkoQuantumExpanderGravitationalwave2019,finesse})~\footnote{Where the fields at a point are propagated inside the cavities and the cavity modes, e.g.\ $\hat a$, are not explicit. Not to be confused with the transfer matrices describing the signal $T$ and noise $R$ responses. The Hamiltonian method is more comprehensive than this approach and could also be modified to use the fields at a point rather than the cavity modes~\cite{danilishinQuantumMeasurementTheory2012}.} was instead used then the limit would instead be a degenerate OPO with added intra-cavity loss to account for the open input test mass port; I leave verifying this to future work.
Therefore, this model predicts that lossy nondegenerate internal squeezing behaves somewhere between the lossless optomechanical analogue and the nondegenerate OPO but closer to the former since the realistic arm loss for future detectors is below this high loss regime (e.g.\ 100~ppm versus above 10000~ppm) and thus the exact behaviour in this regime is not of concern. %And so, I expect features to be inherited from these limiting configurations, e.g.\ that threshold is poorly defined when idler loss is zero should be inherited from the nondegenerate OPO.

Even further validation of this analytic model could be performed by comparing it to a numerical model, which I leave to future work.


\section{Stability and threshold}
\label{sec:stability_and_threshold}

I now determine when nondegenerate internal squeezing is stable and below threshold. %, which is required for experiments. %I will use the no-pump-depletion assumption to link when the system is marginally stable and when it is at threshold.

\subsection{Stability}
\label{sec:nIS_stability}

Stability is a feature of nondegenerate internal squeezing that might not be fully inherited from its limiting configurations. I use the same method to determine stability as degenerate internal squeezing in Appendix~\ref{app:dIS_stability}. The signal and noise responses are fractions of polynomials of $\Omega, \chi$ with denominators~\footnote{I state these for the modulus-squared responses, i.e.\ $(\text{S}_X)_{2,2}$ from Eq.~\ref{eq:nIS_Sx} and $\abs{\left(\text{T}\begin{psmallmatrix}1 \\1\\0\\0\end{psmallmatrix}\right)_2}^2$ from Eq.~\ref{eq:nIS_sigRO_signal_response}, but the poles, i.e.\ zeros of $q$, do not change under the square root.} given by $q(\Omega,\chi)$ and $\Omega^4 q(\Omega,\chi) q(\Omega,-\chi)$, respectively. Here, $q$ only depends on $\chi^2$ and so the noise response denominator is $\Omega^4 q(\Omega,\chi)^2$, where $q$ is some polynomial in $\Omega, \chi$, 
\begin{align}\label{eq:nIS_denom}
q(\Omega,\chi)&=\left(\gamma_a^2+\Omega ^2\right) \left(\Omega ^2 \left({\gamma^b_\text{tot}}^2+{\gamma^c_\text{tot}}^2+2 \chi ^2\right)+\left({\gamma^b_\text{tot}} {\gamma^c_\text{tot}}-\chi ^2\right)^2+\Omega ^4\right)\\
&-2 \omega_s^2 \left(\gamma_a {\gamma^c_\text{tot}} \chi ^2-\gamma_a {\gamma^b_\text{tot}} \left({\gamma^c_\text{tot}}^2+\Omega ^2\right)+\Omega ^2 \left({\gamma^c_\text{tot}}^2+\chi ^2+\Omega ^2\right)\right)+\omega_s^4 \left({\gamma^c_\text{tot}}^2+\Omega ^2\right).\nonumber
\end{align}
This means that the poles of the responses are the shared zeros of $q$~\footnote{The second factor of $q$ in the noise response cancels with a term in the numerator meaning that the multiplicity is the same.}, except for the radiation-pressure noise singularity at $\Omega=0$ which I ignore because it comes from the horizontally free-falling mass assumption and physically the resonance of the test mass is finite. % That the rest of the poles are shared is expected because the stability of the system should be the same for the signal and noise\jam{(should it? no?)}~\cite{}.
Therefore, nondegenerate internal squeezing is unstable if any of the complex $\Omega$ zeros of $q$ have a positive imaginary part and is marginally stable if any of them have no imaginary part~\cite{nise_2019}. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_stability}, the \emph{lossless system is stable below threshold} ($\chi\leq\chi_\text{thr}=\omega_s$) which agrees with Ref.~\cite{liBroadbandSensitivityImprovement2020}. The lossy system is also stable up to a point that I will shortly define to be the threshold. %The behaviour above threshold cannot be inferred using t.
% non-effect of RP, pump phase
Since Eq.~\ref{eq:nIS_denom} only depends on the pump power, readout and loss rates, and sloshing frequency, therefore, other factors, such as radiation pressure or pump phase, do not affect the stability.

I will define the singularity threshold ($\chi_\text{thr}$) such that the system is stable below threshold; the value of $\chi_\text{thr}$ is different between the two cases. I use the parameters in Table~\ref{tab:signal_RO_parameters}.}

\subsection{Singularity threshold}
\label{sec:singularity_threshold}
% motivate this by the previous section's looking at poles, now looking at real poles that could be encountered, to avoid confusion with the complex poles that are always present I will call these real poles ``singularities''

%\jam{(Rewrite the following as the threshold of stability, should just be one paragraph, make clear that the link to gain-loss balancing is just that if there is a net gain but no pump depletion then energy is demonstrably unpreserved and the field will grow without end which is unstable. But be honest that I do not know and that this result would be different with pump-depletion added.)}

%\jam{(Emphasise that this is original work and that it is a clever approach.)}
As discussed in Sections~\ref{sec:dOPO_threshold}, \ref{sec:nOPO_results}, and~\ref{sec:dIS_results}, the threshold of a squeezing system is the boundary where gains balance losses and the no-pump-depletion assumption breaks. Beyond threshold the system begins lasing as the cavity field is (finitely) coherently amplified~\cite{martinelli2001classical} and energy is taken from the pump mode.
Finding the threshold of nondegenerate internal squeezing is required to understand where my model is valid because I assume no pump depletion and, experimentally, how high the pump power can be raised without lasing.
The threshold of lossy degenerate and nondegenerate internal squeezing has not been discussed in the literature to date, and, in this section, I present my method for determining threshold in these models. %, which uses the no-pump-depletion assumption.
Since I assume no pump depletion, beyond threshold, the net gain at the squeezer instead leads to unbounded, coherent amplification of the cavity mode~\cite{walls_1995}, and therefore \emph{the system becomes unstable}. Therefore, my method is to define threshold as the point of marginal stability of the system with no pump depletion and assume that whenever the system becomes unstable it is because of the squeezer reaching threshold.

To explain \emph{how I first devised this method}, which was separate from considering stability, since lossless degenerate internal squeezing on threshold has a minimum squeezed quadrature of zero, I initially tried to maximise the anti-squeezed quadrature of lossy nondegenerate internal squeezing against $(\Omega,\chi)$. But doing so numerically encountered division-by-zero errors which lead me to examine the noise response and find the singularities, i.e.\ the real zeros of $q$, analytically. Then, I connected that the OPOs have singularities at $\Omega=0$ in the anti-squeezed quadrature on threshold and that a pole on the real $\Omega$ axis corresponds to marginal stability.

Formally, my method is to define the \emph{``singularity threshold''}~\footnote{Which might be better called the ``stability threshold''.} as the smallest non-negative~\footnote{Because pump phase is included explicitly in the models, the squeezer parameter is non-negative.} value of the squeezing parameter such that the anti-squeezed quadrature of the quantum noise has a singularity at some (real) frequency. In particular, I look for points where the anti-squeezed quadrature, i.e.\ any of the diagonal terms of $\text{S}_X$, diverges to infinity in $(\Omega,\chi)\subset\mathbb{R}^2$ space~\footnote{To reduce confusion, I do not call these points poles since, unlike when considering stability, I am restricting $\Omega$ to be real and so the noise response is not defined on $\mathbb{C}$.}. %Since I include the pump phase in my models, $\chi$ is further restricted to be positive. \jam{(Check this: looking at the imaginary part of the poles for stability and looking for real poles (i.e. poles on the real axis) for threshold are the same solutions, surely?)}
I define threshold with respect to anti-squeezing because the singularities of the anti-squeezed quadrature are robust to losses, unlike the zeros of the squeezed quadrature, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:dOPO_variances}. 
To validate this method, I find the (real) singularities~\footnote{The reality condition is used to simplify the zeros of $q$, as in the solution for $\chi_\text{thr}$ there is an imaginary component that, when set to zero, gives the real $\Omega$ solution.} of the noise response (squared), i.e.\ the zeros of the denominator of $S_X$, for the other configurations in this thesis with known threshold values, and for nondegenerate internal squeezing, to be

% frequency around which shot noise and signal are amplified in fig:nIS_general_sens is determined (but not exactly) the threshold frequency
% which pole is chosen tells us the closeness to nOPO or lossless sWLC
I have \emph{verified} these values by plotting the noise response and observing the singularity, e.g.\ as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_on_threshold}. For squeezer parameter near threshold, e.g.\ $\chi=0.95\chi_\text{thr}$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_general_sens}, the peak frequency around which the shot noise and signal are amplified is determined by the threshold frequency~\footnote{Consider this peak as a slice with constant $\chi$ of the region around the singularity in (real) $(\Omega,\chi)$ space.}. When multiple singularities are listed above, the singularity threshold is determined by the smallest $\chi$ value:
\begin{equation}
\chi_\text{thr}=\min_{i\in\{1,2\}}(\chi_i),\quad\Omega_\text{thr}=\Omega_{\underset{i\in\{1,2\}}{\text{argmin}}(\chi_i)}.
\end{equation}
Which singularity has the smallest squeezer parameter changes as the losses change, and where it changes, the singularities merge by inspection~\footnote{Therefore, the singularity threshold is continuous for these configurations.}. The smallest squeezer parameter gives the first singularity encountered (at any frequency) when increasing the pump power from zero. %The merging of the singularities could also be used to indicate when the lossy configuration's behaviour becomes closer to the OPO limit than to the lossless configuration, which occurs at unrealistically high arm loss\jam{(quantify)}.
% $\Omega^4$ factor in RP denominator is the resonance, but is unrelated to the squeezer
% pump phase does not change threshold either
The singularity threshold is not affected by radiation pressure or pump phase since they do not affect the zeros of the denominator $q$ of the noise response, as explained in Section~\ref{sec:nIS_stability}. Physically, the radiation-pressure noise does not affect the gain-loss balance and the pump phase only affects where the anti-squeezed quadrature lies in the quadrature basis.
% Although the radiation pressure does introduce (1) a zero at $\Omega=0$ and (2) a factor $q(\Omega,-\chi)$, these can be ignored because, respectively, (1) comes from the free-falling mass assumption which is only valid at frequencies above the actual test mass resonance and therefore the physical behaviour will not have this singularity and (2) only increases the multiplicity of the zeros because the result is independent of pump phase and therefore of the sign of $\chi$.

    \caption{Nondegenerate internal squeezing trajectories of singularities of the anti-squeezed noise in (real) $(\Omega, \chi)$ space as losses are changed. Two effects are shown: (1) the idler loss is changed and the arm loss is zero along the red curve and (2) the idler loss is fixed and the arm loss is changed along the cyan and blue curves. In the former case, the second singularity is at $(0,\infty)$.
    The path from the lossless case to the high arm loss limit goes from point (a) with no loss to point (b) with idler loss $T_{l,c}=0.1$ along the red curve, then changes arm loss to point (c) with $T_{l,a}\approx0.3,\;T_{l,c}=0.1$ along the cyan curve, and, finally, to point (d) with $T_{l,a}=1,\;T_{l,c}=0.1$ along the blue curve. The blue curve does not reach point (d) because of limited numerical sampling.
    I use large idler loss ($T_{l,c}=0.1$) to show the trajectories more clearly, but if it is realistic (e.g.\ $T_{l,c}=1000\text{ppm}$), then (b) and (c) move closer to (a)\jam{(check)}. I use the parameters in Table~\ref{tab:signal_RO_parameters} with zero signal loss ($T_{l,b}$).}

The singularity threshold in Eq.~\ref{eq:singularity_threshold} recovers the known threshold values for the OPOs from Sections~\ref{sec:dOPO_threshold} and~\ref{sec:nOPO_results}. Although it also recovers the threshold for degenerate internal squeezing from Section~\ref{sec:dIS_results}, it does not necessarily find the minimum of the squeezed quadrature, which I discuss in Appendix~\ref{app:dIS_singularity_thr}.
\jam{(Does it agree with existing stability analysis?)}
% this resolves the mystery of idler loss --> means that lossless nIS is necessarily above threshold and therefore not allowed in this model except in formal limits, pump depletion would need to be added in to properly compare to sWLC?
For \emph{nondegenerate internal squeezing}, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_threshold_traj}, in the lossless limit $\gamma_a=0,\gamma_c\rightarrow0$ the singularities approach $(0,\infty)$ and $(0,\omega_s)$ which recovers the exceptional value $\chi_m=\omega_s$ of the coupling rates of the optomechanical analogue from Section~\ref{sec:sWLC}. In that configuration, the threshold can be defined by the same principle of gains and losses applied to the signal and mechanical idler modes driven by the blue-detuned pump laser. Moreover, the marginal stability of the optomechanical system at $\chi_m=\omega_s$ means that a pole in the complex $\Omega$ plane has moved on to the real axis and therefore is a (real) singularity. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_threshold_traj}, as the idler loss $\gamma_c$ is increased from zero with arm loss $\gamma_a=0$, one singularity remains at $(0,\infty)$ and the other converges to $(\omega_s,\sqrt{\gamma^b_\text{tot}\gamma_c})$ when $\gamma_c\rightarrow\infty$\jam{(why does the squeezer parameter decrease with increased loss?)}. Fixing the idler loss at $T_{l,c}=0.1$ and changing the arm loss $\gamma_a$~\footnote{Threshold remains poorly defined when the idler loss is zero\jam{(check where this step is in the derivation)} like the nondegenerate OPO in Section~\ref{sec:nOPO_results}. The lossless limit requires $\gamma^c_\text{tot}\rightarrow0$ to be taken formally.}, the singularities merge at the $\Omega=0$ axis when $\gamma^c_\text{tot}\omega_s^2=\gamma_a\omega_s^2+\mathcal{O}(\gamma_a^2)$ which, assuming that $\gamma_a$ is small compared to $\omega_s$~\footnote{Which is reasonable for a gravitational-wave detector with 4~km arms and realistic $T_{l,a}=100\text{ppm}$ since $\gamma_a$ and $\omega_s$ are 1~Hz and 5~kHz respectively.}, is when $\gamma_c\approx\gamma_a$. In the high arm loss limit $\gamma_a\gg\gamma_c$, the remaining singularity converges to the nondegenerate OPO threshold $(\Omega,\chi)\xrightarrow[\gamma_a\rightarrow\infty]{}(0,\sqrt{\gamma^b_\mathrm{tot}\gamma_c})$, as expected.

Although there is more to understand about singularity threshold, \emph{I will use the ratio to singularity threshold}, henceforth, to normalise the squeezer parameter between different losses and guarantee that the system is stable. For future work, pump depletion could be included in the model to verify threshold by calculating when the coherent amplitude of the output field is non-zero~\footnote{The coherent amplitudes were discarded in the Hamiltonian model when fluctuating components $\delta\hat{Q}(t)$ were taken.}. This would also provide a clearer physical explanation by directly finding the gain-loss balance instead of inferring it from instability under the no-pump-depletion assumption.

% \subsubsection{Problems with definition}
% Although singularity threshold achieves all the known limits for the configurations considered and is simple to determine once the noise transfer function is known, how it relates to gain-loss balancing is unclear.
% % what about other configurations
% Although my arguments should apply generally to squeezed cavity systems, I will only consider the aforementioned configurations and leave a general treatment of singularity threshold to future work.
% % \subsubsection{Physical meaning of singularity threshold}
% Preliminary work?
% noise transfer function is the ratio of the spectrum out to the spectrum in, if the OPO starts lasing then the output has a coherent amplitude but the input is vacuum. FT is steady state
% why does lossless threshold for nIS depend on omega_s while for dIS it does not? because idler mode with zero loss behaves badly
% dIS: what does omega_s^2/\gamma_a represent? the amount of light that returns from the arms?
%\jam{(Is this paragraph necessary?)}
% The physical meaning of singularity threshold is unclear, e.g.\ consider the difference between the lossless limits of the degenerate and nondegenerate internal squeezing cases. For degenerate internal squeezing $\chi_\text{thr}=\gamma^b_R$, while for the nondegenerate case $\chi_\text{thr}=\sqrt{\gamma^b_R(\gamma^c_R+\frac{\omega_s^2}{\gamma^b_R+\gamma^c_R})}$. In either case, the arm loss is zero, so there is no gain or loss associated with the arms or, presumably, the sloshing frequency, but the latter case depends on $\omega_s$\jam{(why?)}. I suspect that this difference arises because the idler is not coupled directly to the arms\jam{(explain more, this could also be checked by coupling directly)}. The gain-loss balance, although simple in the single-mode degenerate OPO, is more complicated to derive with more modes. This motivates the need for methods, like singularity threshold, to find threshold systematically, but these methods must be physically justified. 
%\jam{(This section lacks a key argument, fix it.)}

% Singularity threshold relies on the appearance of a singularity in the anti-squeezed quadrature to detect when the no-pump-depletion assumption has been broken. The no-pump-depletion approximation is valid well below threshold, when gain $\ll$ loss, and is less and less accurate closer and closer to threshold~\cite{}. At threshold~\footnote{Or, more formally, for squeezer parameter infinitesimally above threshold.}, where gain and loss balance, the squeezed cavity starts lasing, energy is lost from the pump mode, and the assumption breaks. The variance of the anti-squeezed quadrature of the output noise is singular at this point because\jam{... (why? this is not clear!)}.
% % infinite fluctuations does not mean increase in time average
% Where the (Fourier domain spectral density) variance of a fluctuating component of a quadrature being singular should not be confused with a change in the time average of that quadrature; the former occurs at singularity threshold and the latter is the change in the coherent amplitude expected to occur at threshold. % an explanation should link these
% It suffices to understand this for the OPOs because the position of the singularity(s) is continuous, i.e.\ the singularity is robust to losses\jam{(is this formally true?)}.
% Therefore, singularity threshold can be understood as\jam{... (complete this when I figure it out)}.

% will this all evaporate when pump depletion is added? yes, its likely
% be critical of approach! instead of finding a work-around for an assumption, should I just remove the no-pump-depletion assumption?
% Using singularity threshold is perhaps unsatisfying because it uses the breaking of an assumption to determine when a physical effect occurs.
% I leave this to future work with my prediction that it would agree with the singularity threshold\jam{(why? I should not make this claim without argument)} but would be more convincing. 
%\jam{(should I be more positive here?)}

\section{Chapter summary}

In this chapter, I have derived and characterised a Hamiltonian model of nondegenerate internal squeezing from the perspective of general quantum metrology.
% Firstly, I explained that a dedicated study of nondegenerate internal squeezing was motivated by the related configurations from the previous chapter.
After motivating the configuration, I derived its sensitivity, partially validating my model by showing that it reduced to the expected high and low loss limits. Finally, I presented my method to find the threshold of nondegenerate internal squeezing by finding where the system is stable. % and the singularities of the anti-squeezed quadrature which appear when the pump-depletion assumption is broken.
% I justified this method by showing that it recovers the known values for the other configurations in this thesis. 
% The results presented in this chapter apply to general cavity-based metrology and, in the following chapters, I will apply them to gravitational-wave detection.

%\jam{(In this chapter, have I been critical enough of my approach?)}
