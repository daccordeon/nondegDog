% chapter introduction

\jam{(Fix up mentions of nondegenerate internal squeezing in background chapters, either explain it earlier or do not confuse the reader)}

% combine the all-optical approach of dIS with the mode structure of sWLC
In this chapter, I present my analytic, Hamiltonian model of nondegenerate internal squeezing and discuss its immediate results.
%Nondegenerate internal squeezing is the same configuration as degenerate internal squeezing except that the squeezer is operated nondegenerately, but it is better thought of as an all-optical alternative to stable optomechanical filtering.
Firstly, I will review the limited literature available about nondegenerate internal squeezing, and conclude that the system with optical loss has never been fully characterised. Secondly, I will present my model and derive and characterise the sensitivity of the configuration. I will partially verify the model by demonstrating that it obeys the expected low and high loss limits, and I will show that the system is stable. Finally, I will find the threshold of nondegenerate internal squeezing using an observation that unites the different squeezing configurations in this thesis. 
% from the view of quantum optics, gravitational waves in the next chapter
This chapter is directed at understanding nondegenerate internal squeezing for general quantum metrology. In the following chapters, I will return to the problem of kilohertz gravitational-wave detection and whether nondegenerate internal squeezing can feasibly improve sensitivity. 


\section{Literature review}
% a gap in the literature, should be much shorter than the review in Section~\ref{sec:literature_review} -- maybe combine it with that one?
% cannot cite personal communication?
% claim: the modelling of this configuration has never been done as thoroughly as my work, explain why (recency of interest)

\jam{(How to be thorough with this section?)}

The available literature on nondegenerate internal squeezing is limited. Although nondegenerate OPOs have long been studied for tests of the EPR-paradox~\cite{Reid1989,Schori2001} and other applications~\cite{,,}, placing a nondegenerate squeezer in a coupled cavity system \jam{has only been studied in ... (I am not aware of any other mentions than Li2020, ask the supervisors.)}. 
Although nondegenerate internal squeezing is motivated by the two configurations in the previous chapter, those configurations have only been studied in the last few years, see Section~\ref{sec:literature_review}. \jam{(Is there direct mention of nIS in the dIS literature?)}
The only direct mention of nondegenerate internal squeezing \jam{(that I could find, check this!)} in the literature is the brief suggestion in Ref.~\cite{Li2020} that it is equivalent to stable optomechanical filtering in the lossless case. In that paper and subsequent work by the same authors~\cite{Li2021}, only mechanical loss is included in the model since it is the dominant source of loss. By the modal equivalence in Section~\ref{sec:modal_equivalence}, I predict that optical loss in the idler mode should be the dominant source of loss for nondegenerate internal squeezing but this is not known. Therefore, I identify this as a gap in the literature, no work has fully characterised nondegenerate internal squeezing with optical loss in every mode, which matters because understanding how the different losses behave determines the feasibility of the design for detection.
 % distribution of loss in applications might be far from uniform, e.g.\ how the detection loss is predicted to be higher than any of the intra-cavity losses for future gravitational-wave detectors~\cite{}.
Not only are the quantum noise and signal responses of the lossy system not known, but other aspects of understanding the system, such as its limits and the squeezing threshold, are not either. I partially fill this gap in this thesis \jam{(colloquial?)}.


\section{Analytic model}

Is this too busy for conceptual understanding?)} Nondegenerate internal squeezing configuration with all modes and losses labelled. The idler mode is not resonant in the arms. The non--loss port mirrors are labelled as the ETM (end test mass), ITM (input test mass), and SRM (signal-recycling mirror). The system's response is shown using the signal arrow and noise ellipse representation from Fig.~\ref{fig:extSqz_config}. Compare to degenerate internal squeezing in Fig.~\ref{fig:dIS_config} and the nondegenerate OPO in Fig.~\ref{fig:nOPO_config}.}
	\label{fig:nIS_config}
\end{figure}

Nondegenerate internal squeezing consists of a nondegenerate squeezer placed inside the signal-recycling cavity of an interferometer, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_config}. It is the same configuration as degenerate internal squeezing, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:dIS_config}, except that the squeezer is operated nondegenerately, but it is better thought of as an all-optical alternative to stable optomechanical filtering, see Section~\ref{sec:modal_equivalence}. In the single-mode approximation, I consider the signal and idler modes resonant in the signal-recycling cavity, where the signal mode of the squeezer is at the carrier frequency $\omega_0$ and is resonant in the arms, while the idler mode at $\omega_0+\Delta$ is not resonant in the arms so that the arm and idler modes are not directly coupled, see Section~\ref{sec:modal_equivalence}. 
I model this configuration using the Hamiltonian method demonstrated several times in this thesis, and in particular, this model combines the nondegenerate OPO and degenerate internal squeezing models in Sections~\ref{sec:nOPO}~\ref{sec:dIS_model}, respectively. % There are no steps in this derivation that have not already appeared in this thesis \jam{(check this)}.
This model is based on and verified, in the lossless case, against Ref.~\cite{Li2020}. 
% \jam{(Probably need to talk about my methodology more -- state that this derivation presented is the last of a long line of increasing complexity (more losses, radiation pressure, pump phase, etc.) and that I have verified at each stage that the model recovers the previous model. This allowed me to also consider the impact of each subsequent addition in isolation. Moreover, I should re-emphasise that it reduces to the lossless case in Li and follows the same path as the verified models of dIS and the OPOs. The point is that this derivation is not controversial.)}
My methodology when constructing this model was to start with the lossless model in Ref.~\cite{Li2020} and progressively add each complication of optical loss in each mode, radiation pressure, and pump phase. At each stage of the progression, I verified that the model recovered the previous stage in the appropriate limits. This allowed me to study the effect of each complication separately rather than study the full model all at once. \jam{(need to be more critical of the approach?)} But, for brevity, I present the full model here.

Let the modes be labelled as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_config}, which is as in Section~\ref{sec:dIS_model} but with the addition of $\hat c$ for the idler mode as in Section~\ref{sec:nOPO}. The Hamiltonian of this system is $\hat H = \hat H_0 + \hat H_I + \hat H_\gamma + \hat H_\text{GW}$ where~\cite{} \jam{(fill in Langevin Hamiltonian. change notation to distinguish $x$ and $\hat x$)}
\begin{align}
\hat H_0 &= \hbar \omega_0 \hat a^\dag \hat a + \hbar \omega_0 \hat b^\dag \hat b+ \hbar (\omega_0+\Delta) \hat c^\dag \hat c + \hbar (2\omega_0+\Delta) \hat u^\dag \hat u\\
\hat H_I &= i\hbar\omega_s(\hat a\hat b^\dag-\hat a^\dag\hat b) + \hbar \frac{x}{2} (e^{i\phi} \hat u \hat b^\dag \hat c^\dag+e^{-i\phi} \hat u^\dag \hat b \hat c) \\
\hat H_\gamma &= \int \ldots \\
\hat H_\text{GW} &= -\alpha (\hat{x}-L_\mathrm{arm}h(t))\left(\frac{\hat{a}+\hat{a}^\dag}{\sqrt{2}}\right)+\frac{1}{2\mu}\hat{p}^2.
\end{align}
As before, $\hat H_0$ describes the decoupled optical system, $\hat H_I$ describes the interaction between the three intra-cavity modes, $\hat H_\gamma$ describes the input/output coupling through the readout and loss ports listed below, and $\hat H_\text{GW}$ describes the coupling to the gravitational-wave signal and the evolution of the test mass mechanical mode.
There is vacuum entering the system intra-cavity to all three modes $\hat n^L_a, \hat n^L_b, \hat n^L_c$, at the readout port $\hat B_\text{in}, \hat C_\text{in}$, and in the detection chain $\hat n^L_\text{PD}$ which will be included later. Only the vacuum entering the readout port is present in the lossless model.
The Heisenberg-Langevin equations-of-motion for these operators can be found as before, using the bosonic and canonical commutation relations with all other commutators zero. I again (1) make the semi-classical and no-pump-depletion approximations to simplify the pump mode $\hat u\mapsto u=2\chi/x$, these approximations are valid below threshold, (2) enter the Interaction Picture to ignore $\hat H_0$, and (3) take fluctuating components of each operator but keep it implicit in the notation ($\delta\hat{Q}(t)\mapsto\hat{Q}$) because it does not change the equations-of-motion \jam{(is this true? it is not clear to me)}. I find the equations-of-motion to be
\begin{equation}\label{eq:nIS_EoM}
\begin{cases}
\dot{\hat{a}}=-\omega_s\hat{b} - \gamma_a \hat{a} + \sqrt{2\gamma_a}\hat{n}^L_a+\frac{i}{\hbar}\alpha(\hat{x}-L_\mathrm{arm}h)\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\\
\dot{\hat{b}}=\omega_s\hat{a} - i\chi e^{i\phi}\hat{c}^\dagger - \gamma^b_\mathrm{tot} \hat{b} + \sqrt{2\gamma^b_R}\hat{B}_\mathrm{in} + \sqrt{2\gamma_b}\hat{n}^L_b\\
\dot{\hat{c}}=-i\chi e^{i\phi}\hat{b}^\dagger - \gamma^c_\mathrm{tot} \hat{c} + \sqrt{2\gamma^c_R}\hat{C}_\mathrm{in} + \sqrt{2\gamma_c}\hat{n}^L_c\\
\dot{\hat{x}}=\frac{1}{\mu}\hat{p}\\
\dot{\hat{p}}=\alpha\left(\frac{\hat{a}+\hat{a}^\dag}{\sqrt{2}}\right).
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
I solve these equations in the Fourier domain. Let $\vec{\hat b}(\Omega)=[\hat b(\Omega), \hat b^\dag(-\Omega), \hat c(\Omega), \hat c^\dag(-\Omega)]^\text{T}$, where I use the compact notation $\tilde{\delta\hat{Q}}(\Omega)\mapsto\hat{Q}(\Omega)$, with similar signal-idler vectorisation for each signal and idler mode as in Section~\ref{sec:nOPO} and $\vec h(\Omega)=\tilde h(\Omega) [1,1,0,0]^\text{T},\quad \vec{\hat a}(\Omega)=[\hat a(\Omega), \hat a^\dag(-\Omega),0,0]^\text{T}$ and similarly for $\vec{\hat n}^L_a(\Omega)$.

The total quantum noise is given by the spectral density matrix Eq.~\ref{eq:total_noise_matrix}, which simplifies, assuming uncorrelated vacuum at each loss port, to
\begin{equation}\label{eq:nIS_Sx}
\text{S}_X=\text{R}_\text{in}\text{R}_\text{in}^\dag+\text{R}^L_a{\text{R}^L_a}^\dag+\text{R}^L_b{\text{R}^L_b}^\dag+\text{R}^L_\text{PD}{\text{R}^L_\text{PD}}^\dag.
\end{equation} % same expression as dIS
Which is divided into 2 by 2 blocks of signal-signal, signal-idler, and idler-idler (co)variances as in Section~\ref{sec:nOPO} \jam{(are the signal-signal and idler-idler covariances all zero? how many freedoms remaining in the signal-idler covariances?)}. The pump phase only appears in the off-diagonal, signal-idler blocks.
The vector of signal transfer functions, with respect to $\tilde h(\Omega)$, to each signal and idler quadrature at the photodetector is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:nIS_sigRO_signal_response}
\text{T}\begin{bsmallmatrix}1 \\1\\0\\0\end{bsmallmatrix} = \frac{2 \beta \sqrt{1-R_\text{PD}} \omega_s}{(\gamma_a-i \Omega ) \left(\chi ^2-(\gamma^b_\text{tot}-i\Omega) (\gamma^c_\text{tot}-i\Omega)\right)-\omega_s^2 (\gamma^c_\text{tot}-i \Omega )} \begin{bsmallmatrix}0 \\-\sqrt{\gamma^b_R}(\gamma^c_\text{tot}-i\Omega)\\\sqrt{\gamma^c_R}\chi\cos(\phi)\\\sqrt{\gamma^c_R}\chi\sin(\phi)\end{bsmallmatrix}.
\end{equation}
Therefore, there is gravitational-wave signal in the second signal quadrature and each idler quadrature. For simplicity and to compare to Ref.~\cite{Li2020}, here I will consider measuring the second signal quadrature which I will refer to as signal readout, henceforth. However, this is not necessarily the optimum readout of the signal quadratures since the noise might be sufficiently lower in the first quadrature to preference a combined measurement. I will consider this and other readout schemes, such as measurements of the idler quadratures and combinations of the signal and idler quadratures, in Chapter~\ref{chp:idler_readout}.
Therefore, the sensitivity of the signal readout scheme, where $\sqrt{S_h}$ is the noise-to-signal ratio, is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:nIS_sigRO_sens}
S_h = \frac{(\text{S}_X)_{2,2}}{\abs{\left(\text{T}\begin{bsmallmatrix}1 \\1\\0\\0\end{bsmallmatrix}\right)_2}^2}.
\end{equation}
% verified these results by repeating the model with 2x2 matrices and 4x4 matrices, important to mention this because it is part of the methodology
\jam{(Include full expression in an appendix?)} I have partially verified this result by repeating the derivation using 2 by 2 matrices~\footnote{Which is not a physically meaningful difference, but it separates the signal and idler such that the derivations are not identical.}, and will compare it to known limits below. %in Section~\ref{sec:nOPO_reduction}.


\section{Results}
\label{sec:nIS_sigRO_results}

\jam{(Are these results quantitative enough?)}

I will now examine some of the immediate results of the model: (1) the general features of the signal and noise responses and sensitivity, (2) the reduction to known models in certain loss limits, and (3) the stability of the system.

\subsection{General behaviour}

Show the effect of increased readout rate on the signal? Explain exactly what formulae the signal and noise responses are given by. Link to section explaining that signal response is unitless.)} Nondegenerate internal squeezing signal readout with all losses included, showing quantum noise response (top panel), signal response (middle panel), and sensitivity (bottom panel). The effect of the squeezer and the radiation pressure noise (turned off by $\rho=0$) on the sensitivity is understood by examining the signal and noise. The slope of the radiation pressure noise with the squeezer on appears to change around 10~Hz which is an effect of losses, and the same effect causes the signal to not be amplified down to DC. The squeezer parameter is normalised to threshold which will be found later.}

Should make plot below threshold, fix the idler loss legend to not include readout rate, show lower frequencies to show readout loss RPN.)} Nondegenerate internal squeezing separate noise transfer functions for each loss port and the total noise response. The detection loss only affects the shot noise after the interferometer and therefore is flat. The other losses are all squeezed and affected by the radiation-pressure noise because they are coupled indirectly to the signal-recycling and arm cavity modes. The readout port followed by the idler intra-cavity loss dominates the other losses, which is likely due to the relative size of the readout $T_\text{SRM}=0.046$ and loss rates and the tolerance to the different losses discussed in the next chapter.}
    \label{fig:nIS_sigRO_noise_budget}
\end{figure}

\jam{(should I show the lossless limit first?)}

% analyse typical nIS plot features before getting into different tests
The sensitivity of nondegenerate internal squeezing is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_general_sens} \jam{(for what parameters?)}. I examine the signal and noise responses separately to understand the origin of the features in the sensitivity curve.
With the squeezer off, the sensitivity curve is shaped by the radiation-pressure noise below 10~Hz and the signal response resonance at the sloshing frequency 5~kHz with bandwidth 500~Hz determined by the signal readout rate $\gamma^b_R$, as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:dIS_results}. With the squeezer turned on, (1) the shot noise is anti-squeezed around a frequency determined by the squeezer parameter, sloshing frequency, and loss rates; (2) the radiation-pressure noise worsens to now dominate below 100~Hz; and (3) the signal is amplified around the same frequency as the shot noise and at frequencies down to 10~Hz, below which it converges to the value without squeezing due to losses. These changes mean that the squeezer improves the sensitivity from 40--4000~Hz and worsens it outside that band except above 10~kHz where the sensitivity converges to the value without squeezing.
These quoted frequencies are specific to this parameter set but the general performance is the same: nondegenerate internal squeezing leads to improved sensitivity at some broad range of ``middle'' frequencies at the cost of ``low'' frequency sensitivity. 
Some of these effects will be explained later, e.g.\ the frequency around which the shot noise and the signal peak are amplified is determined by the threshold of the system, but some of these results can be explained immediately.
 % and the effect of losses will be left until I consider gravitational-wave detection feasibility.
% changing the signal response via the white-light cavity effect?
% why aren't the changes local to the sloshing frequency, like dIS?
The signal response is amplified by analogy to the filter (white-light) cavity effect of the optomechanical analogue, the resonance of the coupled cavity system is changed by introducing the idler mode \jam{(is this true? I am not sure. the signal response still falls off at the same rate so bandwidth doesn't seem to improve except by the LF amplification?)}. The change in the resonance behaviour from a two-mode to a three-mode coupled system means that the changes are not localised to the sloshing frequency, unlike degenerate internal squeezing in Section~\ref{sec:dIS_results} \jam{(check this, shouldn't this mean that they are still expected around the coupling frequencies?)}. 
%In the simple explanation of the signal-recycling cavity reflecting the light back into the arms to experience the gravitational wave more, the addition of the idler mode, which is not directly coupled to the arms or measured, somehow \jam{(how/why? this is wishy-washy)}.
% why does radiation pressure noise worsen?
% ~\footnote{I only talk about the radiation pressure noise where it is dominant, i.e.\ at ``low'' frequencies below the Standard Quantum Limit \jam{(is this necessary to say?)}}
Therefore, the radiation pressure noise at ``low'' frequencies can be affected. \jam{(why does the other quadrature appear now? is it worsened proportionally to the pump power?)}.

To understand how the radiation pressure noise is affected, I consider how it appears in each of the contributions to the total quantum noise, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_sigRO_noise_budget}. The radiation pressure noise appears in the contribution from the readout port and each intra-cavity loss port because these noises are coupled indirectly to the arm mode, unlike the detection loss which therefore has only shot noise. In particular, opening the idler readout port introduces more vacuum and turning the squeezer on indirectly couples the idler mode and this noise into the signal readout, which is why radiation pressure noise worsens by turning the squeezer on even when there are no losses \jam{(check this)}, which will be shown later in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_lossless}.
\jam{(why is the shot noise not amplified at LF?)}
% This is because the radiation pressure noise, with the gravitational-wave signal, enters the measured, second signal quadrature after the input test mass. Having already seen the arm cavity loss, it gets added here to each of the noises that travel through the signal mode \jam{(what am I trying to say?)}. It is then anti-squeezed \jam{(check this)} and read out.

% explain the effect of each parameter? (except leave tolerance to losses to science case chapter)
% in terms of the configuration parameters rather than derived parameters such as the sloshing frequency and readout rates
\jam{(Is this paragraph necessary? true? complete?)}
The effect of each configuration parameter is similar to the effect on the interferometer without squeezing in Sections~\ref{sec:intro_IFO}~\ref{sec:dIS_results}. To summarise, increasing the circulating power in the arms increases the sensitivity at all frequencies. Increasing the arm length increases the same scalar factor $\beta$ as the power but also reduces the free-spectral range of the signal response (i.e.\ the signal response falls off at a lower frequency) and decreases the sloshing (peak) frequency. The sloshing frequency also decreases with decreased input test mass transmission and longer signal-recycling cavities. Increasing the signal-recycling length decreases the bandwidth of the signal peak \jam{(Are there two bandwidths? The FSR of the arms sets where the signal falls off and the readout rate sets the smaller bandwidth around the sloshing frequency peak? If so, then clarify.)}, which is also decreased by decreased signal-recycling mirror transmission. The radiation-pressure noise increases with heavier test masses and increased pump power. Finally, increased pump power also increases the peak shot noise and signal amplification, and the pump phase does not affect signal readout. \jam{(I am claiming a lot here without figures or citations, what to include?)}


\subsection{Reduction to known systems}

% show that this follows from the EoM but can be verified by looking at the plots
To partially verify the model, I show that it reduces to the expected limits when (1) the losses are removed and (2) the arm loss is taken to infinity. I predict the behaviour by taking the limits of the equations-of-motion in Eq.~\ref{eq:nIS_EoM} and verify it by examining the plots of the noise and signal responses.

\subsubsection{Lossless limit}
\label{sec:nIS_lossless_limit}

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{nIS_lossless.pdf}

Then say ``The responses converge as expected.'' etc.)} Compare to the lossy configuration in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_general_sens}.}
	\label{fig:nIS_lossless}
\end{figure}

In the lossless limit, $\gamma_a=\gamma_b=\gamma_c=R_\text{PD}=0$, with the idler readout rate turned off, $\gamma^c_R=0$, the equations-of-motion of nondegenerate internal squeezing reduce to those of the lossless optomechanical analogue in Ref.~\cite{Li2020}. Comparing the resulting noise, signal, and sensitivity, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_lossless}, \jam{the signal transfer function and the radiation-pressure noise do not agree with the predicted limit. The signal transfer function in Eq.~\ref{eq:nIS_sigRO_signal_response} requires a factor $\sqrt2$ and the test mass requires a factor $2$. (why? check quadrature and strain normalisation? does my method of finding the signal transfer function agree with Korobko?)}
I will compare the lossy all-optical and optomechanical analogues in the next chapter. 
% no losses means no antisqueezing of shot noise but yes RPN, why? threshold=0 problem?
Without losses, the shot noise is not anti-squeezed and the signal amplification persists down to DC. Since the idler readout rate is zero and there is no loss, the threshold is poorly defined because there is no mechanism for light to leave the idler mode, which will be discussed later. However, taking the limit of smaller and smaller losses shows that the shot noise peak decreases for fixed pump power below threshold \jam{(check this, why?)}. The DC signal amplification is lost when losses are added \jam{(why? compare lossless and lossy plots directly)}.


\subsubsection{High arm loss limit}
\label{sec:nOPO_reduction}

	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{nIS_nOPO_limit.pdf}

\end{figure}

% full 4x4 matrix agrees, not just variance 1,1
% give best explanation of ITM T=0, but can admit that while the maths is clear the physics is not obvious -- potentially requires more thought
In the high arm loss limit, $\gamma_a\rightarrow\infty$, the equations-of-motion of nondegenerate internal squeezing reduce to Eq.~\ref{eq:nOPO_EoM} for a nondegenerate OPO between the signal-recycling mirror and a fully-reflective input test mass. Comparing the shot noise of both systems, Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_signal_nOPO_limit} shows that the signal variances converge in the high arm loss limit, and by inspection the rest of the shot noise matrix $\text{S}_X$ also converges. This is similar to how the shot noise of degenerate internal squeezing converges to that of a degenerate OPO with the input test mass fully reflective, see Fig.~\ref{fig:dIS_limit_dOPO}, where the same explanation holds for why the mirror is fully reflective as Section~\ref{sec:dIS_optical_loss}. 

% therefore mystery of the idler loss carries over: idler loss cannot be zero
Therefore, for a given set of losses, nondegenerate internal squeezing exists somewhere between the lossless optomechanical analogue and the nondegenerate OPO. And so, I expect features to be inherited from these limiting configurations, such as how the fact that threshold is poorly defined when idler loss is zero is inherited from the nondegenerate OPO.


\subsection{Stability}
\label{sec:nIS_stability}

% plot: imaginary part of poles
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{nIS_stability.pdf}
	\caption{\jam{(Purpose: show stability)} \jam{(Does this stability plot make sense?

	\label{fig:nIS_stability}
\end{figure}

Stability is a feature of nondegenerate internal squeezing that might not be fully inherited from its limiting configurations. I use the same method to determine stability as Section~\ref{sec:dIS_results}. Like degenerate internal squeezing, the signal and noise transfer functions are rational functions of $\Omega, \chi$ with denominators~\footnote{I state these for the modulus-squared transfer functions, i.e.\ the numerator and denominator in Eq.~\ref{eq:nIS_sigRO_sens}, but the poles, i.e.\ zeros of $q$, do not change under the square root.} given by $q(\Omega,\chi)$ and $\Omega^4 q(\Omega,\chi) q(\Omega,-\chi)$, respectively, except that here $q$ only depends on $\chi^2$ and so the noise transfer function denominator is $\Omega^4 q(\Omega,\chi)^2$, where $q$ is some polynomial in $\Omega, \chi$, 
\begin{align}\label{eq:nIS_denom}
q(\Omega,\chi)&=\left(\gamma_a^2+\Omega ^2\right) \left(\Omega ^2 \left({\gamma^b_\text{tot}}^2+{\gamma^c_\text{tot}}^2+2 \chi ^2\right)+\left({\gamma^b_\text{tot}} {\gamma^c_\text{tot}}-\chi ^2\right)^2+\Omega ^4\right)\\
&-2 \omega_s^2 \left(\gamma_a {\gamma^c_\text{tot}} \chi ^2-\gamma_a {\gamma^b_\text{tot}} \left({\gamma^c_\text{tot}}^2+\Omega ^2\right)+\Omega ^2 \left({\gamma^c_\text{tot}}^2+\chi ^2+\Omega ^2\right)\right)+\omega_s^4 \left({\gamma^c_\text{tot}}^2+\Omega ^2\right).
\end{align}
This means that the zeros of the transfer functions are the shared zeros of $q$, except for the radiation-pressure noise singularity at $\Omega=0$ which I ignore because it comes from the horizontally free-falling mass assumption and is a pole on the real axis. That the rest of the poles are shared is expected because the stability of the system should be the same for the signal and noise \jam{(should it?)}~\cite{}.
Therefore, nondegenerate internal squeezing is unstable if any of the complex $\Omega$ zeros of $q$ have a positive imaginary part. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_stability}, the lossless system is stable for all $\chi\leq\omega_s$ and the lossy system is stable for \jam{... (complete after normalising lossy plot to threshold)}. I will show shortly that this means that nondegenerate internal squeezing is stable below threshold, like its two limiting configurations. Because the no-pump-depletion assumption breaks above threshold, the behaviour there cannot be inferred from Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_stability}.
% non-effect of RP, pump phase
Since Eq.~\ref{eq:nIS_denom} only depends on the pump power, readout and loss rates, and sloshing frequency, other factors, such as radiation pressure or pump phase, do not affect the zeros of $q$ or the stability.

\jam{(need to worry about MIMO now? see Li2021)}

\section{Singularity threshold}
\label{sec:singularity_threshold}
% motivate this by the previous section's looking at poles, now looking at real poles that could be encountered, to avoid confusion with the complex poles that are always present I will call these real poles ``singularities''

\jam{(Motivate this as finding the squeezer parameter such that the system is stable. Move stability analysis into this section.)}

% \jam{(Emphasise that this is original work and that it is a clever approach.)}
As established in Sections~\ref{sec:dOPO_threshold}~\ref{sec:nOPO_results}~\ref{sec:dIS_results}, the threshold of a squeezing system is the boundary where gains balance losses and the no-pump-depletion assumption breaks. Finding the threshold of nondegenerate internal squeezing is required to understand where this model is valid and, experimentally, how high the pump power can be raised without lasing. Although threshold is well-understood for the OPOs and lossless degenerate internal squeezing, the threshold of lossy degenerate and nondegenerate internal squeezing is not available in the literature \jam{(check this)}. In this section, I present my method for determining threshold in all of these models, which uses the no-pump-depletion assumption.
To explain how I devised this method, since lossless degenerate internal squeezing on threshold has a minimum squeezed quadrature of zero, I initially tried to maximise the anti-squeezed quadrature of nondegenerate internal squeezing against $\Omega,\chi$. But performing this numerically encountered division-by-zero errors which prompted me to examine the transfer functions and find the singularities, i.e.\ the real zeros of $q$, analytically. The key insight was then realising that both the OPOs have singularities at $\Omega=0$ in the anti-squeezed quadrature on threshold.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{nIS_on_threshold.pdf}
    \caption{\jam{(Purpose: show that singularity threshold actually gives singularities -- is this necessary?)} \jam{(Is the signal/sensitivity instructive?)} Nondegenerate internal squeezing noise, signal, and sensitivity when approaching and at threshold. At threshold, the no-pump-depletion assumption breaks and the transfer functions are singular. The peaks in the noise and signal responses are finite and a false peak in the sensitivity appears at the threshold frequency because of numerical error and limited sample points \jam{(check this)}. For the threshold behaviour of the other configurations in this thesis see Figs.~\ref{fig:dOPO_variances}~\ref{fig:nOPO_variances}~\ref{fig:dIS_sensitivity}~\ref{fig:sWLC_sensitivity}.}
    \label{fig:nIS_on_threshold}
\end{figure}

My method to determine threshold is to define the ``singularity threshold'' as the smallest non-negative~\footnote{Because pump phase is included explicitly in the models, the squeezer parameter is non-negative.} value of the squeezing parameter such that the anti-squeezed quadrature of the quantum noise has a singularity at some (real) frequency. In particular, I look for points where the anti-squeezed quadrature, i.e.\ any of the diagonal terms of $\text{S}_X$, diverges to infinity in $(\Omega,\chi)\subset\mathbb{R}^2$ space~\footnote{To reduce confusion, I do not call these points poles since, unlike when considering stability, I am restricting $\Omega$ to be real and so the transfer function is not defined on $\mathbb{C}$.}. %Since I include the pump phase in my models, $\chi$ is further restricted to be positive.  \jam{(Check this: looking at the imaginary part of the poles for stability and looking for real poles (i.e. poles on the real axis) for threshold are the same solutions, surely?)}
Defining threshold with respect to anti-squeezing is better than squeezing because the singularities of the anti-squeezed quadrature are expected to be robust to losses, unlike the zeros of the squeezed quadrature, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:dOPO_variances}. 
I find the (real~\footnote{The reality condition is used to simplify the zeros of $q$, as in the solution for $\chi^2$ there is an imaginary component that, when set to zero, gives the real $\Omega$ solution.}) singularities of the noise transfer function (squared) $S_X$, i.e.\ the zeros of its denominator, for each squeezing configuration in this thesis to be at \jam{(check that $\gamma_c\mapsto\gamma^c_\text{tot}$)}

% frequency around which shot noise and signal are amplified in fig:nIS_general_sens is determined (but not exactly) the threshold frequency
% which pole is chosen tells us the closeness to nOPO or lossless sWLC
I have verified these values by plotting the noise transfer function and observing the singularity, e.g.\ as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_on_threshold}. For squeezer parameter just below threshold, e.g.\ $\chi=0.95\chi_\text{thr}$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_general_sens}, the peak frequency around which the shot noise and signal are amplified is determined by the threshold frequency~\footnote{Consider this peak as a slice with constant $\chi$ of the region around the singularity in (real) $\Omega,\chi$ space.}. If multiple singularities are listed above, the singularity threshold is determined by the smallest $\chi$ value $$\chi_\text{thr}=\min_{i\in\{1,2\}}(\chi_i),\quad\Omega_\text{thr}=\Omega_{\underset{i\in\{1,2\}}{\text{argmin}}(\chi_i)}.$$ Which singularity has the smallest squeezer parameter changes as the losses change, and, by inspection for internal squeezing, where it changes the singularities merge which makes the singularity threshold continuous. The smallest squeezer parameter gives the first singularity hit when the pump power is increased from zero. The merging of the singularities could also be used, informally, as the point where the lossy configuration becomes closer in behaviour to the OPO limit than to the lossless configuration.

Singularity threshold recovers the known threshold values for the OPOs from Sections~\ref{sec:dOPO_threshold}~\ref{sec:nOPO_results} by inspection, degenerate internal squeezing from Section~\ref{sec:dIS_results}, and the optomechanical analogue from Section~\ref{sec:sWLC}. %, but its behaviour with loss is more complex for internal squeezing. 
For degenerate internal squeezing, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:dIS_threshold_traj}, in the lossless case the singularities $(\Omega,\chi)$ are at $(0,\infty)$ and $(\omega_s,\gamma^b_\text{tot})$ which recovers $(\Omega_\text{thr},\chi_\text{thr})\xrightarrow[\gamma_a\rightarrow0]{}(\omega_s,\gamma^b_\mathrm{tot})$ from Section~\ref{sec:dIS_results}. As the arm loss $\gamma_a$ is increased from zero, the singularities move and merge at the $\Omega=0$ axis when $\gamma_a=\omega_s$, and then the remaining singularity converges to the degenerate OPO threshold $(\Omega_\text{thr},\chi_\text{thr})\xrightarrow[\gamma_a\rightarrow\infty]{}(0,\gamma^b_\mathrm{tot})$ in the high arm loss limit, as expected.
% this resolves the mystery of idler loss --> means that lossless nIS is necessarily above threshold and therefore not allowed in this model except in formal limits, pump depletion would need to be added in to properly compare to sWLC?
For nondegenerate internal squeezing, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:nIS_threshold_traj} for fixed signal loss $T_{l,b}=0.1$ \jam{(not useful, set to zero)} and no idler readout rate $\gamma^c_R=0$ to compare to the optomechanical analogue, in the lossless limit $\gamma_a=0,\gamma_c\rightarrow0$ the singularities approach $(0,\infty)$ and $(0,\omega_s)$ which recovers the $\chi_\text{thr}=\omega_s$ analogue to the exceptional value $\chi_m=\omega_s$ from Section~\ref{sec:sWLC}. Where the same principle of gains and losses applies to the signal and mechanical idler modes which are driven by a blue-detuned pump laser~\cite{} \jam{(this detail is missing from sWLC section, add it in there)}. Moreover, the marginal stability of the optomechanical system at $\chi_m=\omega_s$ means that a pole in the complex $\Omega$ plane has moved on to the real axis and therefore is a (real) singularity. As the idler loss $\gamma_c$ is increased from zero with arm loss $\gamma_a=0$, one singularity remains at $(0,\infty)$ and the other converges to $(\omega_s,\sqrt{\gamma^b_\text{tot}\gamma_c})$ when $\gamma_c\rightarrow\infty$. Fixing the idler loss at $T_{l,c}=0.1$ and changing the arm loss $\gamma_a$~\footnote{Threshold remains poorly defined when the idler loss is zero \jam{(check where this step is in the derivation)} like the nondegenerate OPO in Section~\ref{sec:nOPO_results}. The lossless limit requires $\gamma^c_\text{tot}\rightarrow0$ to be taken formally.}, the singularities merge \jam{(check this)} at the $\Omega=0$ axis when $\gamma^c_\text{tot}\omega_s^2=\gamma_a\omega_s^2+\mathcal{O}(\gamma_a^2)$ which, assuming that $\gamma_a$ is small compared to $\omega_s$~\footnote{Which is reasonable for a gravitational-wave interferometer with $T_{l,a}=100\text{ppm}$ where $\gamma_a/(2\pi)<1$~Hz but $\omega_s/(2\pi)=5$~kHz.}, is approximately \jam{(redundant with $\approx$?)} when $\gamma_c\approx\gamma_a$. In the high arm loss limit $\gamma_a\gg\gamma_c$, the remaining singularity converges to the nondegenerate OPO threshold $(\Omega,\chi)\xrightarrow[\gamma_a\rightarrow\infty]{}(0,\sqrt{\gamma^b_\mathrm{tot}\gamma_c})$, as expected.

% $\Omega^4$ factor in RP denominator is the resonance, but is unrelated to the squeezer
% pump phase does not change threshold either
Singularity threshold is not affected by radiation pressure or pump phase since they do not affect the zeros of the denominator $q$ of the noise transfer function. As explained in the stability analysis in Section~\ref{sec:nIS_stability}, although the radiation pressure does introduce (1) a zero at $\Omega=0$ and (2) a factor $q(\Omega,-\chi)$, these can be ignored because, respectively, (1) comes from the free-falling mass assumption which is only valid at frequencies above the actual test mass resonance and therefore the physical behaviour will not have this singularity and (2) only increases the multiplicity of the zeros because the result is independent of pump phase and therefore of the sign of $\chi$. The pump phase is irrelevant because the singularity threshold looks at the anti-squeezed quadrature, which always exists by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, but does not depend on where in the quadrature basis it lies.


\subsection{Problems with definition}

Although singularity threshold achieves all the known limits for the configurations considered and is simple to determine once the noise transfer function is known, it has two main problems to address: (1) how it relates to gain-loss balancing and (2) how maximising the anti-squeezed quadrature relates to minimising the squeezed quadrature. 
% what about other configurations
Although my arguments should apply generally to squeezed cavity systems, I will only consider the aforementioned configurations and leave a general treatment of singularity threshold to future work.

\subsubsection{Physical meaning of singularity threshold}
% Preliminary work?
% noise transfer function is the ratio of the spectrum out to the spectrum in, if the OPO starts lasing then the output has a coherent amplitude but the input is vacuum. FT is steady state

\jam{(Rewrite as the threshold of stability.)}

% why does lossless threshold for nIS depend on omega_s while for dIS it does not? because idler mode with zero loss behaves badly
% dIS: what does omega_s^2/\gamma_a represent? the amount of light that returns from the arms?
\jam{(Is this paragraph necessary?)}
The physical meaning of singularity threshold is unclear, e.g.\ consider the difference between the lossless limits of the degenerate and nondegenerate internal squeezing cases. For degenerate internal squeezing $\chi_\text{thr}=\gamma^b_R$, while for the nondegenerate case $\chi_\text{thr}=\sqrt{\gamma^b_R(\gamma^c_R+\frac{\omega_s^2}{\gamma^b_R+\gamma^c_R})}$. In either case, the arm loss is zero, so there is no gain or loss associated with the arms or, presumably, the sloshing frequency, but the latter case depends on $\omega_s$ \jam{(why?)}. I suspect that this difference arises because the idler is not coupled directly to the arms \jam{(explain more, this could also be checked by coupling directly)}. The gain-loss balance, although simple in the single-mode degenerate OPO, is more complicated to derive with more modes. This motivates the need for methods, like singularity threshold, to find threshold systematically, but these methods must be physically justified. 

\jam{(This section lacks a key argument, fix it.)}

Singularity threshold relies on the appearance of a singularity in the anti-squeezed quadrature to detect when the no-pump-depletion assumption has been broken. The no-pump-depletion approximation is valid well below threshold, when gain $\ll$ loss, and is less and less accurate closer and closer to threshold~\cite{}. At threshold~\footnote{Or, more formally, for squeezer parameter infinitesimally above threshold.}, where gain and loss balance, the squeezed cavity starts lasing, energy is lost from the pump mode, and the assumption breaks. The variance of the anti-squeezed quadrature of the output noise is singular at this point because \jam{... (why? this is not clear!)}.
% infinite fluctuations does not mean increase in time average
Where the (Fourier domain spectral density) variance of a fluctuating component of a quadrature being singular should not be confused with a change in the time average of that quadrature; the former occurs at singularity threshold and the latter is the change in the coherent amplitude expected to occur at threshold. % an explanation should link these
It suffices to understand this for the OPOs because the position of the singularity(s) is continuous, i.e.\ the singularity is robust to losses \jam{(is this formally true?)}.
Therefore, singularity threshold can be understood as \jam{... (complete this when I figure it out)}.

% will this all evaporate when pump depletion is added? yes, its likely
% be critical of approach! instead of finding a work-around for an assumption, should I just remove the no-pump-depletion assumption?
Using singularity threshold is perhaps unsatisfying because it uses the breaking of an assumption to determine when a physical effect occurs. Instead, the assumption could be dropped and pump depletion included in the model~\cite{,}, from which threshold could be determined by examining when the coherent amplitude of the output field is non-zero~\footnote{The coherent amplitudes were discarded in the Hamiltonian model when fluctuating components $\delta\hat{Q}(t)$ were taken.}. I leave this to future work with my prediction that it would agree with the singularity threshold \jam{(why? I should not make this claim without argument)} but would be more convincing. 

\subsubsection{Disagreement between squeezed and anti-squeezed quadratures}
% Degenerate internal squeezing - different notions of threshold
%shouldn't this be in the dIS sub-chapter? no.
% make clear that knowing threshold just gives the physical bounds of the parameter space, it doesn't correspond to the optimal squeezing (see results section) for sensitivity improvement -- just as minimising N does not necessarily maximise SNR if signal is not considered. 
% \jam{(One explanation for the difference between position of the singularity of the anti-squeezed quadrature and the minimum of the squeezed quadrature is that the expression for the sloshing frequency in Korobko et al, 2019 is not valid at large arm losses. If this is so, then what does this fixed--sloshing frequency Hamiltonian correspond to? And for that system, why does the supposedly Gaussian squeezing not maximise antisqz at the frequency that it minimises squeezing? --> Look at pump phase and/or covariance matrix)}

	\label{fig:dIS_on_threshold}
\end{figure}

\jam{(Keep this short, I care about nIS not dIS.)}
For degenerate squeezing, singularity threshold is where the anti-squeezed quadrature diverges and therefore has the maximum peak value, but this does not necessarily correspond to where the squeezed quadrature has the minimum peak value~\footnote{Throughout this discussion I am only optimising the quantum noise and not the sensitivity.}, i.e.\ where the peak is the most squeezed towards zero. This is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:dIS_on_threshold} where the minimum squeezing occurs at $76\%$ \jam{(check this)} singularity threshold and the relative difference is only large (above a percent threshold) in the high arm loss limit \jam{(quantify this)}. This does not violate the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle because the losses increase the uncertainty product~\cite{}, i.e.\ , inefficiently, the anti-squeezed variance is increased more than the squeezed variance is decreased~\footnote{But the squeezing remains Gaussian~\cite{}, i.e.\ the squeezed noise ellipse's area is increased but remains an ellipse with semi-axes that represent the standard deviations of the Gaussian noise in each quadrature. \jam{(check this)}}.  
% The extrema, of which there are a maximum of two at any point, start at the same points, but have different trajectories, e.g.\ the first point moving initially into the $\Omega>\omega_s$ region instead, and merge at the different point on the y-axis, but converge to the same OPO limit (although the numerical sampling does not show it here). This difference does not violate the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle \jam{(but why does it occur?)}.
Singularity threshold uses singularities of the anti-squeezed quadrature rather than zeroes of the squeezed quadrature because the former are robust to losses unlike the latter, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:dIS_on_threshold} where the minimum is not at zero. Since zeros might not exist, if instead the minima of the squeezed quadrature were used to similarly define threshold, then their trajectories in (real) $(\Omega,\chi)$ space would be as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:dIS_threshold_traj}. These trajectories achieve the same limits as but diverge from the singularity trajectories. But this difference is only significant \jam{(quantify)} with high arm losses that are far above realistic cavity-based detectors, e.g.\ Fig.~\ref{fig:dIS_on_threshold} uses $T_{l,a}=800000~\text{ppm}$ compared to $100~\text{ppm}$ predicted for future gravitational-wave detectors. Therefore, because of this and that I am studying nondegenerate squeezing, this problem is not of concern for using singularity threshold in nondegenerate internal squeezing \jam{(what about combined readout?)}. I do not understand why this difference occurs \jam{(check this)}, however, two possible explanations are that it comes from the different shapes of the limiting curves for each quadrature of the lossy degenerate OPO in Fig.~\ref{fig:dOPO_variances} or that the approximation to the sloshing frequency in Section~\ref{sec:dIS_model} breaks down in the high arm loss limit~\footnote{In which case this model might not represent the physical system in that limit.}~\cite{}.


Despite these two problems with singularity threshold, since the first problem cannot be resolved without deriving a pump-depletion model for the system that has not yet been done \jam{(which I avoid why?)} and the second problem is not relevant to nondegenerate internal squeezing, singularity threshold remains the only known value of threshold for nondegenerate internal squeezing~\cite{}. Therefore, henceforth, I will use the ratio to singularity threshold to normalise the squeezer parameter between different losses, and I leave resolving these remaining problems to future work. 
\jam{(should I be more positive here?)}

In this chapter, I have derived and characterised a Hamiltonian model of nondegenerate internal squeezing. Firstly, I identified that a dedicated study of lossy nondegenerate internal squeezing was absent from the literature but was motivated by the promising performance of the related configurations in the previous chapter. Secondly, using the methods from the previous chapters, I derived the quantum noise--limited sensitivity and stability of the system, and discussed the general features of its signal and noise responses. I partially verified this analytic model by showing that it reduced to the known limits. Finally, I presented a \jam{(should I say my?)} technique to find the threshold of nondegenerate internal squeezing using the singularities of the anti-squeezed quadrature which appear when the pump-depletion assumption is broken \jam{(check this)}. I justified this singularity threshold by showing that it reduced to the known values for the other configurations in this thesis, and, despite some remaining issues with its physicality, I will use it to normalise the squeezer parameter. 
The results presented in this chapter apply generally to cavity-based metrology and I will apply them in the following chapters to gravitational-wave detection.

\jam{(In this chapter, have I been critical enough of my approach? ``Problems with definition'' is pretty critical of singularity threshold, but what about the rest of the modelling and results?)}
