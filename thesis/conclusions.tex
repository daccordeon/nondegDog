\label{chp:future_work_and_conclusions}
% return to aims




% results are promising but not explosive
% nIS certainly warrants more attention as an all-optical alternative to sWLC for future detectors + there is a lot of benefit to looking into combined readout
% singularity threshold definition works well here -- can we directly show that it corresponds to the gain=loss threshold, also pump depletion models exist to test this



\section{Limitations}
% limitations



\section{Future work}

% the techniques of detection are ultimately not limited to gravitational waves. broader quantum metrology can benefit

% optimum readout


\subsubsection*{Back-action evasion in non-degenerate internal squeezing}
