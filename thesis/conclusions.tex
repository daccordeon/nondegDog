In this thesis, I have investigated nondegenerate internal squeezing from the perspectives of general quantum metrology	and gravitational-wave detection.
% studied nondegenerate internal squeezing to see if it could improve the kilohertz sensitivity of future gravitational-wave detectors.
% key results: I have characterised nIS with separate signal and idler readouts, particularly its optical loss tolerance and squeezing threshold; nIS is more tolerant to loss than dIS; nIS is a valid all-optical alternative to sWLC; nIS signal readout can achieve the kilohertz target at peak sensitivity but not across 1--4~kHz for LIGO~Voyager without external squeezing or increased circulating power; nIS could also be used for broadband 100--4000~Hz detection using incoherently combined signal and idler readouts
Firstly, I have developed a model of nondegenerate internal squeezing using an analytic, Hamiltonian method that incorporates optical losses. I validated this model by showing that it reduces to the correct high and low loss limits. I have shown that it is stable and calculated its squeezing threshold, and compared the different possible readout schemes, showing that signal readout is limited by idler loss and idler readout is limited by signal loss.
Secondly, using my model, I have evaluated the feasibility of nondegenerate internal squeezing for gravitational-wave detection in comparison to existing proposals. Assuming realistic optical losses, I have found that it is a viable all-optical alternative to stable optomechanical filtering and that it is more resistant than degenerate internal squeezing to detection and signal losses. %\jam{(comparably if not more?)}
Finally, I have shown that nondegenerate internal squeezing using signal readout can achieve the kilohertz sensitivity target to detect a typical post-merger signal from a binary neutron-star merger at peak sensitivity but not across the full 1--4~kHz band. %, where I calculated the sensitivity for a detector like LIGO~Voyager without external squeezing or increased circulating power.
I have also shown that using incoherently combined signal and idler readouts can improve broadband 100--4000~Hz\jam{(check range)} sensitivity. %\jam{(should I mention increased radiation-pressure noise?)}.
% interpretation: nIS is a loss-resistant, all-optical configuration that can improve interferometer sensitivity without increased circulating power. it is most suitable for improving shot noise--limited sensitivity from 100--4000~Hz, including kilohertz sensitivity from 1--4~kHz.
In summary, I have found that nondegenerate internal squeezing is a detection loss-resistant, all-optical configuration that improves quantum noise--limited sensitivity and could be used for kilohertz (1--4~kHz) or broadband (0.1--4~Hz) gravitational-wave detection.

% contribution (aim 2: gap in the literature):  the only understanding of nIS in the literature is through the optomechanical analogue, and although the behaviour is largely the same, I have characterised it separately with loss in every mode. I contribute its threshold, limits, comparison to existing proposals including the optomechanical analogue, and feasibility for gravitational-wave detection (where the different states of optical and mechanical loss technology matter).  but this goes beyond GW-detection to general cavity-based metrology as well
This thesis \emph{contributes a characterisation of nondegenerate internal squeezing} that was previously understood only by analogy to stable optomechanical filtering. Although the lossless Hamiltonians of these two systems are equivalent, the feasibility of using an optical versus a mechanical idler mode, respectively, is different. I have found that the optical loss required to match the low mechanical loss assumed for stable optomechanical filtering is optimistic but at least as realistic as that low mechanical loss. Also, combining signal and idler readouts is likely easier using nondegenerate internal squeezing. Moreover, I have characterised elements of the lossy configuration that were not present in the literature to date, e.g.\ the squeezing threshold and the response to the different sources of optical loss.
% by improving kHz sensitivity, astrophysics is improved...

% results are promising but not explosive
% sensitivity target is hard to achieve broadband at current power (and without external squeezing as well etc.), maybe possible for a Voyage-like detector to achieve it at some peak frequency
% nIS is resistant to detection and signal losses, but vulnerable to idler loss (unless we exploit a combined readout and use the leakage through the SRM?)
% nIS certainly warrants more attention as an all-optical alternative to sWLC for future detectors + there is a lot of benefit to looking into combined readout
% singularity threshold definition works well here -- can we directly show that it corresponds to the gain=loss threshold, also pump depletion models exist to test this


\section{Future work}
\label{sec:future_work}

% \jam{(Search through thesis to check if all mentions of future work show up here.)}

The results in this thesis indicate several possible avenues of future research into nondegenerate internal squeezing. %Four main directions are (1) extensions of the model, (2) coherently combined readout, (3) connections to PT-symmetry theory, and (4) an experimental demonstration of the results.

% \subsubsection{Extensions of the model} %\section{Limitations of this work}
% is your approach good or to be avoided? --> the Hamiltonian method is robust and good, the question is whether my assumptions are good
% be very critical!

% \jam{(have I been critical enough? are there other limitations that I've missed that aren't explicit assumptions?)}
The \emph{model in this thesis could be extended} to make stronger claims about the best configuration for future detectors by removing some of the simplifying assumptions used.
% Although the Hamiltonian method I use is widely used in the literature and therefore is the approach I recommend for future work,
% Some of the assumptions that I have made in the model  are not generally valid.
% Firstly, some of my assumptions are generally valid, e.g.\ assuming uncorrelated vacuum and $\Delta\ll\omega_0$, or ignore phenomena that affect Michelson interferometers uniformly and therefore do not distinguish between configurations, e.g.\ assuming that circulating power cannot increase and that any incident gravitational wave is polarised to achieve the maximal signal response. These assumptions should be maintained in future work.
Some of my assumptions limit the frequency range in which the estimated sensitivity is accurate such as to below the arm cavity free spectral range of $37.5$~kHz to maintain the single-mode approximation~\footnote{Other such assumptions include assuming that quantum noise is the dominant noise source and that the test masses are horizontally free-falling which restrict the frequencies to be above 100~Hz\jam{(give frequencies?)}.}. These assumptions can be appropriately avoided in future work, e.g.\ by using a multi-mode model~\cite{liEnhancingInterferometerSensitivity2021}, to predict the behaviour of nondegenerate internal squeezing outside the 100--4000~Hz\jam{(check)} frequency range that I study.
Similarly, the no-pump-depletion and semi-classical pump approximations should be dropped to predict the behaviour above threshold and more accurately at, e.g., 95--100~$\%$ threshold. A pump depletion model could also replace or verify the singularity threshold definition with a more physical one related directly to gains and losses. 
There are also other possible extensions to enrich understanding such as a more thorough stability analysis~\cite{liEnhancingInterferometerSensitivity2021}, verifying the high loss limit using a transfer matrix method~\cite{}, and checking if nondegenerate becomes degenerate internal squeezing using coherently combined readout when the idler is coupled to the arm mode.

When these extended models are used to judge the \emph{feasibility of future detectors}, my assumptions about what is realistic should be examined given the unknowns of future technological and astrophysical progress, e.g.\ what losses are realistic or optimistic and what astrophysical sensitivity is required. These assumptions are hard to improve upon and should be updated with the best understanding of the time.
% In summary, the results that I have shown are valid within the parameter range stated but not otherwise, and future work should remove the appropriate assumptions that limit extending the results.
% To better judge the feasibility of nondegenerate internal squeezing for gravitational-wave detection, the above improvements could be made along with adding the effects of external squeezing, detuning~\cite{}, and other noise sources than quantum noise such as thermal noise at the test masses~\cite{}. %These additions would give a more realistic estimate of the performance, including the sensitivity, stability, and threshold, of a future detector. 
These extensions might also necessitate using numerical modelling in an optics simulation tool such as \code{FINESSE}~\cite{finesse}~\footnote{This would require the addition of a nondegenerate internal squeezer component similar to the degenerate internal squeezer component (\code{nle}) currently available on the \code{PyKat} developer branch but otherwise could be modelled using the standard library~\cite{BROWN_PYKAT}.\jam{(does Finesse have this component already?)}}. This could also be used for validation of the lossy model of nondegenerate internal squeezing, however, it is not a priority since I have already partially validated my analytic model by showing that it reduces to the correct limits. % ``Finesse~\cite{}, which CAN(?) also be used'' -MJ
Using either the analytic or numerical models, the sensitivity could then be optimised to discover the best parameters for a realistic future detector and determine whether such a detector could meet the astrophysical sensitivity targets. %, e.g.\ achieve the kilohertz target from 1--4~kHz.

%\jam{(do I need to say this?)} A problem with my approach that is more difficult to address is the lack of physical intuition for why the sensitivity of a given configuration behaves the way it does. Beyond explaining the general features of the signal and the quantum noise, which I have done, the model provides little explanation for why, for example, the idler readout is better at low frequencies than the signal readout\jam{(check)}. I do not believe that there is an alternative method that would make these facts more evident, but this might limit the amount of physics to be gained directly from further modelling.

% \subsubsection{Coherently combined readout}

% understanding combined readout
% optimum readout (e.g.\ Wiener filter for integrated sensitivity from 10 Hz to 10 kHz)
% tunability between idler and signal readouts, frequency-dependent combination/readout angles
\emph{Coherently combined readout} might lead to better sensitivity than the other readout schemes because of the addition of the signal-idler correlations which I have derived but not studied. This is motivated by promising results for the coherently combined readout of stable optomechanical filtering~\cite{liEnhancingInterferometerSensitivity2021}. The next steps to characterise the coherently combined readout would be similar to the signal and idler readouts. I would first examine the effects of realistic optical loss, the readout rates, pump power, pump phase, and the readout angles $(\psi_0,\psi_1,\psi_2)$ on the signal and noise responses. Then, I would find a Wiener filter for the sensitivity, i.e.\ the readout angles to maximise the sensitivity at each frequency. Since the choice of angles can recover signal or idler readout, this Wiener filter would be at least as sensitive as either readout separately or optimally incoherently combined. A similar process restricted to only combining the signal quadratures could determine the optimum readout angles for signal readout, and similarly for idler readout. Finally, I would compare this optimum sensitivity to the suitable astrophysical targets to judge the feasibility for gravitational-wave detection.
 % The coherently combined readout cannot generally recover incoherently combined readout, however, the optimal incoherently combined readout is the envelope of the separate readouts, which coherently combined readout can recover\jam{(check)}.
Therefore, coherently combined readout should be studied to find the best sensitivity that nondegenerate internal squeezing can achieve.
% Similarly, for the existing readout schemes, the parameters of the configuration 

% \subsubsection{Connection to PT-symmetry theory}

% Carl Bender: investigate the exceptional point of lossless sWLC by checking the bounded-from-below condition on the Hamiltonian transformed into continuous co-ordinate (quasi-quadrature?) space as to whether it is accidental or true, if true then the square-root singularity is what is enhancing sensitivity. Moreover, the optical system, if above threshold is also modelled, could be used to experimentally demonstrate the change in the g.s. energy as it is adiabatically transported onto the other sheets (see Carl's example), which would be very exciting to witness. Alternatively, could check the type of exceptional point by varying the coupling constants and calculating the eigenvalues and see if they just cross on the real axis but stay on it. --> cite personal communication
% requires pump-depletion. even if PT-symmetry is true in lossless case, then it is unclear that it would be possible to show it experimentally because losses make the system open and not Hermitian nor PT-symmetric
The \emph{PT-symmetry} of lossless nondegenerate internal squeezing at threshold could be further investigated~\cite{CMBPersonalCommunication}. In particular, it could be checked whether the PT-symmetry is responsible for the enhanced sensitivity.
% used to demonstrate a theoretical result from PT-symmetry theory
PT-symmetry theory only predicts there to be enhanced sensitivity if the Exceptional Point, see Section~\ref{sec:sWLC}, is not accidental~\cite{}, i.e.\ that the degenerate real eigenvalue pair at threshold becomes a complex eigenvalue pair above threshold. This has not been shown and would mean that the Hamiltonian is not Hermitian above threshold which is a situation studied in PT-symmetry theory~\cite{}. To determine if this is the case using a pump-depletion model, either the boundedness-from-below of the Hamiltonian could be checked~\cite{} or the eigenvalues could be explicitly calculated~\cite{}.
PT-symmetry could also be investigated in the lossy case, where it is expected to break~\cite{}, and with radiation pressure included, where it is necessary to couple a negative--effective mass mechanical oscillator to the arm mode to maintain PT-symmetry by comparison to the back-action evasion studied for the optomechanical analogue~\cite{liBroadbandSensitivityImprovement2020}.

% Supposing that this is the case, which might not be true, then there is a branch point in the complex eigenvalue plane at the Exceptional Point and PT-symmetry theory predicts that the ground state energy on the other Riemann sheet(s) that the branch cut connects to could be different to the starting sheet~\cite{}.
% This could be tested experimentally with signal readout by starting with the ground state of the system with the squeezer off, adiabatically transporting it above threshold, across the branch cut onto the second sheet, and back below threshold to where the squeezer is off again. Then, comparing the ground state energy before and after the process would test the PT-symmetry theory. I do not know whether PT-symmetry theory can still predict something about the lossy system where the losses break the PT-symmetry\jam{(check)}, but it is worth further investigation.\jam{(does this make any sense?)}

% \subsubsection{Table-top experimental demonstration}

Finally, the model in this thesis could be used to design an \emph{experiment to demonstrate nondegenerate internal squeezing} and enhanced interferometer sensitivity with PT-symmetry~\cite{}. This would require using the parameters and losses realistic to a contemporary, table-top experiment, e.g.\ Ref.~\cite{}, rather than a future gravitational-wave detector.


\subsubsection{Final word}
The future work suggested above is only some of the potential research motivated by the promising results about nondegenerate internal squeezing in this thesis.
By improving the possible sensitivity for future gravitational-wave detectors, this thesis is part of the effort to detect and study new astrophysical sources, e.g.\ the detection of kilohertz gravitational-waves from the post-merger remnant of a binary neutron-star merger might lead to better understanding exotic states of matter.
The results in this thesis also apply beyond gravitational-wave detection to general quantum metrology and using nondegenerate internal squeezing in other applications, e.g.\ axion detection to constrain theories of dark matter~\cite{,liBroadbandSensitivityImprovement2020}.
