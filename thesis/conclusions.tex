\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{chp:future_work_and_conclusions}
% return to aims
% is your approach good or to be avoided?
% synthesis and critical analysis --> talk about your results beyond the plots, what do they mean?



% results are promising but not explosive <-- don't say this, hype the results!
% sensitivity target is hard to achieve broadband at current power (and without external squeezing as well etc.), maybe possible for a Voyage-like detector to achieve it at some peak frequency
% nIS is resistant to detection and signal losses, but vulnerable to idler loss (unless we exploit a combined readout and use the leakage through the SRM?)
% nIS certainly warrants more attention as an all-optical alternative to sWLC for future detectors + there is a lot of benefit to looking into combined readout
% singularity threshold definition works well here -- can we directly show that it corresponds to the gain=loss threshold, also pump depletion models exist to test this



\section{Limitations}
% be very critical!

% sensitivity target conditions on EoS

% trawl through the thesis and find all approximations used, do a big round up of them and why each might be problematic

% lack of physical understanding, e.g.\ behaviour of signal versus idler readout --> perhaps a more abstract approach could see past the complications of all of the interferometer parameters to address the underlying structure, e.g.\ study the normal modes of the three coupled oscillators


\section{Future work}

% the techniques of detection are ultimately not limited to gravitational waves. broader quantum metrology can benefit

% understanding idler readout and particularly combined readout
% optimum readout (e.g.\ Weiner filter for integrated sensitivity from 10 Hz to 10 kHz)
% tunability between idler and signal readouts, frequency-dependent combination/readout angles

% add external squeezing ? caves's amplifier

% Finesse numerical modelling, for verification and extension past limitations above -- e.g. multimode, detuning, etc.. numerical modelling of pump depletion?

% \subsubsection*{Back-action evasion in non-degenerate internal squeezing}
