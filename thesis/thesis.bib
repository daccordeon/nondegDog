  abstract = {We propose adding a nonlinear element to a long signal recycling cavity to enhance the high-frequency sensitivity (900 Hz\textendash 5 kHz) of a kilometer-scale interferometric gravitational wave detector. Using numbers for absorption and scattering losses in the detector consistent with advanced LIGO+, we demonstrate a factor of 3.5 improvement in quantum noise limited strain sensitivity in the kHz regime. Such a configuration is robust to internal losses and reduces the requirement on the amount of circulating power in the detector to achieve sensitivity comparable to future gravitational wave detectors. This proposed configuration is compatible with the existing gravitational wave detector vacuum infrastructure and could enable exploration of exotic science, such as observing the merger phase of binary neutron stars, which in turn may provide constraints on the neutron star equation of state.},

Suppressing it can be achieved by using non-classical states and quantum filters, which modify both the noise and signal response. We find a novel approach to realising quantum filters directly from their frequency-domain transfer functions, utilising techniques developed by the quantum control community. It not only allows us to construct quantum filters that defy intuition, but also opens a path towards the systematic design of optimal quantum measurement devices. As an illustration, we show a new optical realisation of an active unstable filter with anomalous dispersion, proposed for improving the quantum-limited sensitivity of gravitational-wave detectors.},

  abstract = {The gravitational waveform of merging binary neutron stars encodes information about extreme states of matter. Probing these gravitational emissions requires the gravitational-wave detectors to have high sensitivity above 1 kHz. Fortunately for current advanced detectors, there is a sizeable gap between the quantum-limited sensitivity and the classical noise at high frequencies. Here we propose a detector design that closes such a gap by reducing the high-frequency quantum noise with an active optomechanical filter, frequency-dependent squeezing, and high optical power. The resulting noise level from 1 kHz to 4 kHz approaches the current facility limit and is a factor of 20 to 30 below the design of existing advanced detectors. This will allow for precision measurements of (i) the post-merger signal of the binary neutron star, (ii) late-time inspiral, merger, and ringdown of low-mass black hole-neutron star systems, and possible detection of (iii) high-frequency modes during supernovae explosions. This design tries to maximize the science return of current facilities by achieving a sensitive frequency band that is complementary to the longer-baseline third-generation detectors: the10 km Einstein Telescope, and 40 km Cosmic Explorer. We have highlighted the main technical challenges towards realizing the design, which requires dedicated research programs. If demonstrated in current facilities, the techniques can be transferred to new facilities with longer baselines.},

  abstract = {Detections of gravitational waves (GW) in the frequency band 35 Hz to 500 Hz have led to the birth of GW astronomy. Expected signals above 500 Hz, such as the quasinormal modes of lower mass black holes and neutron star mergers signatures are currently not detectable due to increasing quantum shot noise at high frequencies. Squeezed vacuum injection has been shown to allow broadband sensitivity improvement, but this technique does not change the slope of the noise at high frequency. It has been shown that white light signal recycling using negative dispersion optomechanical filter cavities with strong optical dilution for thermal noise suppression can in principle allow broadband high frequency sensitivity improvement. Here we present detailed modelling of AlGaAs/GaAs optomechanical filters to identify the available parameter space in which such filters can achieve the low thermal noise required to allow useful sensitivity improvement at high frequency. Material losses, the resolved sideband condition and internal acoustic modes dictate the need for resonators substantially smaller than previously suggested. We identify suitable resonator dimensions and show that a 30 \textmu m scale cat-flap resonator combined with optical squeezing allows 8 fold improvement of strain sensitivity at 2 kHz compared with Advanced LIGO. This corresponds to a detection volume increase of a factor of 500 for sources in this frequency range.},

Experimental data for two resonators are combined with analytic models of interferometers similar to LIGO to demonstrate enhancement across a broader band of frequencies versus dual-recycled Fabry-Perot Michelson detectors. Candidate resonators are a silicon nitride membrane acoustically isolated by a phononic crystal, and a single-crystal quartz acoustic cavity. Optical power requirements favour the membrane resonator, while thermal noise performance favours the quartz resonator. Both could be implemented as add-on components to existing detectors.},

The class of active filters includes the Butterworth filter, which can be used to enhance the capacity of an optical quantum communication channel, and the non-reciprocal amplifier, which enables back-action-free measurement of a superconducting qubit. A particularly detailed investigation is performed on the unstable active filter for realizing a broadband gravitational-wave detector; that is, the feedback amplification method is used to construct an active filter that compensates the phase delay of the signal and eventually recovers the sensitivity in the high frequency regime.},

  abstract = {The coherent quantum noise cancellation (CQNC) strategy has been performed in the single-mode optomechanical systems to promote an ultra-sensitive metrology protocol to break the standard quantum limit. The key idea of CQNC is that the backaction noises arising from radiation pressure and driving can be offset by coupling the optical mode to a near-resonant ancillary mode. In this work, a continuous weak-force sensing under CQNC is developed in a double-mode optomechanical system consisted of two optical modes with distinct frequencies and a mechanical mode. In particular, under the asymmetrical treatment by driving the higher-frequency optical mode, probing the lower-frequency one, and coupling the probe mode to the ancillary mode, our configuration can be used to resemble the conventional CQNC sensing. It is more important to find that the current CQNC strategy simultaneously stabilizes the double-mode system with respect to both the constrained driving power (the Routh-Hurwitz criterion) and the effective positive mechanical damping (the stable optical-spring condition). Moreover, through exploiting the coupling between the probe mode and the ancillary mode under this nontrivial extension of the CQNC strategy (from the single-mode version to the double-mode one), the rotating-wave term and the counter-rotating term are found to be responsible to the system stability and the noise cancellation, respectively. In realistic situations, our scheme can be practiced in a tripartite optomechanical setup with a membrane in the middle and a twisted-cavity-based weak-torque detector.},

The time when their sensitivity will be mainly limited by the quantum noise of light is around the corner, and finding ways to reduce it will become a necessity. Therefore, the primary goal we pursued in this review was to familiarize a broad spectrum of readers with the theory of quantum measurements in the very form it finds application in the area of gravitational-wave detection. We focus on how quantum noise arises in gravitational-wave interferometers and what limitations it imposes on the achievable sensitivity. We start from the very basic concepts and gradually advance to the general linear quantum measurement theory and its application to the calculation of quantum noise in the contemporary and planned interferometric detectors of gravitational radiation of the first and second generation. Special attention is paid to the concept of the Standard Quantum Limit and the methods of its surmounting.},

  abstract = {This paper examines single-mode and two-mode Gaussian pure states (GPS), quantum mechanical pure states with Gaussian wave functions. These states are produced when harmonic oscillators in their ground states are exposed to potentials, or interaction Hamiltonians, that are linear or quadratic in the position and momentum variables (i.e., annihilation and creation operators) of the oscillators. The physical and group theoretical properties of these Hamiltonians and the unitary operators they generate are discussed. These properties lead to a natural classification scheme for GPS. Important properties of single-mode and two-mode GPS are discussed. An efficient vector notation is introduced, and used to derive many of the important properties of GPS and of the Hamiltonians and unitary operators associated with them.}

  abstract = {Quantum noise limits the sensitivity of laser interferometric gravitational-wave detectors. Given the state-of-the-art optics, the optical losses define the lower bound of the best possible quantum-limited detector sensitivity. In this work, we come up with a broadband signal recycling scheme which gives potential solution to approaching this lower bound by converting the signal recycling cavity to be a broadband signal amplifier using an active optomechanical filter. We will show the difference and advantage of such a scheme compared with the previous white light cavity scheme using the optomechanical filter in [Phys.Rev.Lett.115.211104 (2015)]. The drawback is that the new scheme is more susceptible to the thermal noise of the mechanical oscillator.},

We demonstrate that strongly driven double-Λ systems can show negative dispersion without absorption, which is needed in order to compensate for the variation of the wavelength with frequency. Internal buildup profiles and the cavity bandwidth of standard devices and white-light cavities will be briefly compared. These devices may be useful to improve the bandwidth and sensitivity of future generations of laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors.}

Here we report on the development of ‘cat-flap’ micro-pendulums consisting of sub-millimetre scale micromirrors supported by nanometre-thickness flexures. The micromirror pendulum is designed to achieve the lowest possible flexure stiffness, which enables maximal dilution of mechanical losses through the use of optical springs. An angular spring constant of , corresponding to a fundamental frequency (in the absence of gravity) of 18 Hz has been demonstrated. It is shown that Q-factors up to at an optical spring frequency of 25 kHz could be achieved with these pendulums. By extrapolating the measurement results to a sample with a double thickness mirror pad, we estimate that it may be possible to achieve a Q-factor of at 100 kHz at room temperature.}

title = "Proposal for gravitational-wave detection beyond the standard quantum limit through EPR entanglement",
abstract = "In continuously monitored systems the standard quantum limit is given by the trade-off between shot noise and back-action noise. In gravitational-wave detectors, such as Advanced LIGO, both contributions can be simultaneously squeezed in a broad frequency band by injecting a spectrum of squeezed vacuum states with a frequency-dependent squeeze angle. This approach requires setting up an additional long baseline, low-loss filter cavity in a vacuum system at the detector's site. Here, we show that the need for such a filter cavity can be eliminated, by exploiting Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR)-entangled signals and idler beams. By harnessing their mutual quantum correlations and the difference in the way each beam propagates in the interferometer, we can engineer the input signal beam to have the appropriate frequency-dependent conditional squeezing once the out-going idler beam is detected. Our proposal is appropriate for all future gravitational-wave detectors for achieving sensitivities beyond the standard quantum limit.",

abstract = {Axions comprise a broad class of particles that can play a major role in explaining the unknown aspects of cosmology. They are also well-motivated within high energy physics, appearing in theories related to CP-violation in the standard model, supersymmetric theories, and theories with extra-dimensions, including string theory, and so axion cosmology offers us a unique view onto these theories. I review the motivation and models for axions in particle physics and string theory. I then present a comprehensive and pedagogical view on the cosmology and astrophysics of axion-like particles, starting from inflation and progressing via BBN, the CMB, reionization and structure formation, up to the present-day Universe. Topics covered include: axion dark matter (DM); direct and indirect detection of axions, reviewing existing and future experiments; axions as dark radiation; axions and the cosmological constant problem; decays of heavy axions; axions and stellar astrophysics; black hole superradiance; axions and astrophysical magnetic fields; axion inflation, and axion DM as an indirect probe of inflation. A major focus is on the population of ultralight axions created via vacuum realignment, and its role as a DM candidate with distinctive phenomenology. Cosmological observations place robust constraints on the axion mass and relic density in this scenario, and I review where such constraints come from. I next cover aspects of galaxy formation with axion DM, and ways this can be used to further search for evidence of axions. An absolute lower bound on DM particle mass is established. It is ma>10−24eV from linear observables, extending to ma≳10−22eV from non-linear observables, and has the potential to reach ma≳10−18eV in the future. These bounds are weaker if the axion is not all of the DM, giving rise to limits on the relic density at low mass. This leads to the exciting possibility that the effects of axion DM on structure formation could one day be detected, and the axion mass and relic density measured from cosmological observables.}
