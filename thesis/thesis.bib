  abstract = {We propose adding a nonlinear element to a long signal recycling cavity to enhance the high-frequency sensitivity (900 Hz\textendash 5 kHz) of a kilometer-scale interferometric gravitational wave detector. Using numbers for absorption and scattering losses in the detector consistent with advanced LIGO+, we demonstrate a factor of 3.5 improvement in quantum noise limited strain sensitivity in the kHz regime. Such a configuration is robust to internal losses and reduces the requirement on the amount of circulating power in the detector to achieve sensitivity comparable to future gravitational wave detectors. This proposed configuration is compatible with the existing gravitational wave detector vacuum infrastructure and could enable exploration of exotic science, such as observing the merger phase of binary neutron stars, which in turn may provide constraints on the neutron star equation of state.},

Suppressing it can be achieved by using non-classical states and quantum filters, which modify both the noise and signal response. We find a novel approach to realising quantum filters directly from their frequency-domain transfer functions, utilising techniques developed by the quantum control community. It not only allows us to construct quantum filters that defy intuition, but also opens a path towards the systematic design of optimal quantum measurement devices. As an illustration, we show a new optical realisation of an active unstable filter with anomalous dispersion, proposed for improving the quantum-limited sensitivity of gravitational-wave detectors.},

We propose a stable quantum amplifier applicable to linear systems operating at the fundamental detection limits, enabled by two-mode non-degenerate parametric amplification. At threshold, one mode of the amplifier forms a PT-symmetric system of original detector mode.

  abstract = {Quantum noise limits the sensitivity of precision measurement devices, such as laser interferometer gravitational-wave observatories and axion detectors. In the shot-noise-limited regime, these resonant detectors are subject to a trade-off between the peak sensitivity and bandwidth. One approach to circumvent this limitation in gravitational-wave detectors is to embed an anomalous-dispersion optomechanical filter to broaden the bandwidth. The original filter cavity design, however, makes the entire system unstable. Recently, we proposed the coherent feedback between the arm cavity and the optomechanical filter to eliminate the instability via PT-symmetry. The original analysis based upon the Hamiltonian formalism adopted the single-mode and resolved-sideband approximations. In this paper, we go beyond these approximations and consider realistic parameters. We show that the main conclusion concerning stability remains intact, with both Nyquist analysis and a detailed time-domain simulation.},

  abstract = {The gravitational waveform of merging binary neutron stars encodes information about extreme states of matter. Probing these gravitational emissions requires the gravitational-wave detectors to have high sensitivity above 1 kHz. Fortunately for current advanced detectors, there is a sizeable gap between the quantum-limited sensitivity and the classical noise at high frequencies. Here we propose a detector design that closes such a gap by reducing the high-frequency quantum noise with an active optomechanical filter, frequency-dependent squeezing, and high optical power. The resulting noise level from 1 kHz to 4 kHz approaches the current facility limit and is a factor of 20 to 30 below the design of existing advanced detectors. This will allow for precision measurements of (i) the post-merger signal of the binary neutron star, (ii) late-time inspiral, merger, and ringdown of low-mass black hole-neutron star systems, and possible detection of (iii) high-frequency modes during supernovae explosions. This design tries to maximize the science return of current facilities by achieving a sensitive frequency band that is complementary to the longer-baseline third-generation detectors: the10 km Einstein Telescope, and 40 km Cosmic Explorer. We have highlighted the main technical challenges towards realizing the design, which requires dedicated research programs. If demonstrated in current facilities, the techniques can be transferred to new facilities with longer baselines.},

  abstract = {Detections of gravitational waves (GW) in the frequency band 35 Hz to 500 Hz have led to the birth of GW astronomy. Expected signals above 500 Hz, such as the quasinormal modes of lower mass black holes and neutron star mergers signatures are currently not detectable due to increasing quantum shot noise at high frequencies. Squeezed vacuum injection has been shown to allow broadband sensitivity improvement, but this technique does not change the slope of the noise at high frequency. It has been shown that white light signal recycling using negative dispersion optomechanical filter cavities with strong optical dilution for thermal noise suppression can in principle allow broadband high frequency sensitivity improvement. Here we present detailed modelling of AlGaAs/GaAs optomechanical filters to identify the available parameter space in which such filters can achieve the low thermal noise required to allow useful sensitivity improvement at high frequency. Material losses, the resolved sideband condition and internal acoustic modes dictate the need for resonators substantially smaller than previously suggested. We identify suitable resonator dimensions and show that a 30 \textmu m scale cat-flap resonator combined with optical squeezing allows 8 fold improvement of strain sensitivity at 2 kHz compared with Advanced LIGO. This corresponds to a detection volume increase of a factor of 500 for sources in this frequency range.},

Candidate resonators are a silicon nitride membrane acoustically isolated by a phononic crystal, and a single-crystal quartz acoustic cavity. Optical power requirements favour the membrane resonator, while thermal noise performance favours the quartz resonator. Both could be implemented as add-on components to existing detectors.},

The class of active filters includes the Butterworth filter, which can be used to enhance the capacity of an optical quantum communication channel, and the non-reciprocal amplifier, which enables back-action-free measurement of a superconducting qubit. A particularly detailed investigation is performed on the unstable active filter for realizing a broadband gravitational-wave detector; that is, the feedback amplification method is used to construct an active filter that compensates the phase delay of the signal and eventually recovers the sensitivity in the high frequency regime.},

  abstract = {The coherent quantum noise cancellation (CQNC) strategy has been performed in the single-mode optomechanical systems to promote an ultra-sensitive metrology protocol to break the standard quantum limit. The key idea of CQNC is that the backaction noises arising from radiation pressure and driving can be offset by coupling the optical mode to a near-resonant ancillary mode. In this work, a continuous weak-force sensing under CQNC is developed in a double-mode optomechanical system consisted of two optical modes with distinct frequencies and a mechanical mode. In particular, under the asymmetrical treatment by driving the higher-frequency optical mode, probing the lower-frequency one, and coupling the probe mode to the ancillary mode, our configuration can be used to resemble the conventional CQNC sensing. It is more important to find that the current CQNC strategy simultaneously stabilizes the double-mode system with respect to both the constrained driving power (the Routh-Hurwitz criterion) and the effective positive mechanical damping (the stable optical-spring condition). Moreover, through exploiting the coupling between the probe mode and the ancillary mode under this nontrivial extension of the CQNC strategy (from the single-mode version to the double-mode one), the rotating-wave term and the counter-rotating term are found to be responsible to the system stability and the noise cancellation, respectively. In realistic situations, our scheme can be practiced in a tripartite optomechanical setup with a membrane in the middle and a twisted-cavity-based weak-torque detector.},

  abstract = {The fast progress in improving the sensitivity of the gravitational-wave detectors, we all have witnessed in the recent years, has propelled the scientific community to the point at which quantum behavior of such immense measurement devices as kilometer-long interferometers starts to matter. The time when their sensitivity will be mainly limited by the quantum noise of light is around the corner, and finding ways to reduce it will become a necessity. Therefore, the primary goal we pursued in this review was to familiarize a broad spectrum of readers with the theory of quantum measurements in the very form it finds application in the area of gravitational-wave detection. We focus on how quantum noise arises in gravitational-wave interferometers and what limitations it imposes on the achievable sensitivity. We start from the very basic concepts and gradually advance to the general linear quantum measurement theory and its application to the calculation of quantum noise in the contemporary and planned interferometric detectors of gravitational radiation of the first and second generation. Special attention is paid to the concept of the Standard Quantum Limit and the methods of its surmounting.},

  abstract = {This paper examines single-mode and two-mode Gaussian pure states (GPS), quantum mechanical pure states with Gaussian wave functions. These states are produced when harmonic oscillators in their ground states are exposed to potentials, or interaction Hamiltonians, that are linear or quadratic in the position and momentum variables (i.e., annihilation and creation operators) of the oscillators. The physical and group theoretical properties of these Hamiltonians and the unitary operators they generate are discussed. These properties lead to a natural classification scheme for GPS. Important properties of single-mode and two-mode GPS are discussed. An efficient vector notation is introduced, and used to derive many of the important properties of GPS and of the Hamiltonians and unitary operators associated with them.}

Given the state-of-the-art optics, the optical losses define the lower bound of the best possible quantum-limited detector sensitivity. In this work, we come up with a broadband signal recycling scheme which gives potential solution to approaching this lower bound by converting the signal recycling cavity to be a broadband signal amplifier using an active optomechanical filter. We will show the difference and advantage of such a scheme compared with the previous white light cavity scheme using the optomechanical filter in [Phys.Rev.Lett.115.211104 (2015)]. The drawback is that the new scheme is more susceptible to the thermal noise of the mechanical oscillator.},
