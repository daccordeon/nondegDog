\section{Existing proposal 1: degenerate internal squeezing}

% \subsection{Internal squeezing}

% internal squeezing = two coupled cavities

% Korobko et al, 2019

\subsection{Analytic model}

This derivation is available in Ref.~\cite{}, but I include it here to demonstrate the Hamiltonian method I use later on and to directly compare the results. \jam{Appendix?}



\subsection{Problems with proposal - vulnerability to optical loss}

\section{Existing proposal 2: stable optomechanical filtering}

% Li et al, 2020

\subsection{Problems with proposal - vulnerability to thermal noise and mechanical quality factor}
