\chapter{Existing proposal 1: degenerate internal squeezing}

% \subsection{Internal squeezing}

% internal squeezing = two coupled cavities

% Korobko et al, 2019

\section{Analytic model}

This derivation is available in Ref.~\cite{}, but I include it here to demonstrate the Hamiltonian method I use later on and to directly compare the results. \jam{Appendix?}
