% chapter introduction

In this chapter, I will review the necessary physics to describe the quantum noise that affects interferometric gravitational-wave detectors. I will use the conventional treatment of quantum noise widely available in the quantum optics literature~\cite{Danilishin,MiaoQCRB}, which builds from the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle to the quantum noise response of a detector. 
I will then introduce the technique of squeezing, which can favourably manipulate the quantum noise. Then, demonstrate the Hamiltonian modelling of squeezing that I will continue to use throughout this thesis. I will derive the response of the well-studied optical parametric oscillator (OPO) in both the degenerate and nondegenerate cases. These models will be expanded upon by adding additional modes in later chapters, so it is well-worth carefully understanding the base model. Finally, I will explain how squeezing is currently used in Advanced LIGO to lower the quantum noise~\cite{} and set-up the motivation for the more complex uses of squeezing in the next chapter and in my work.

% I will first review the background theory of quantum noise and squeezing in Chapter~\ref{chp:background_theory}, to have the tools to describe the quantum noise response of a detector. In this chapter, I will demonstrate the analytic, Hamiltonian modelling, that I will then use throughout the thesis, on the simple, well-known cases of degenerate and nondegenerate optical parametric oscillators (OPOs, i.e.\ squeezed cavities)~\cite{}.

\section{Quantum noise}
\label{sec:qnoise}
% HUP

Quantum noise, at its most general, refers to any source of noise caused by the quantum-mechanical, fundamental uncertainties in the state of a detector. This covers many different phenomena, from vacuum fluctuations to back-action caused by a measurement~\cite{}. For the light in a cavity-based detector, the amplitude and phase of a particular mode are conjugate quantities related by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, meaning that they can never be simultaneously, exactly known. This uncertainty in the amplitude and phase of the light in different parts of the detector will appear as quantum noise in the final measurement. %Throughout this thesis, I will just focus on uncertainty in the light incident on the photodetector and not consider the complications of readout. % oddly placed sentence

To express these uncertainties formally, I use the Heisenberg Picture (and later the Interaction Picture) used throughout the literature~\cite{Danilishin,}. Let the time-domain creation and annihilation operators of a particular cavity mode (e.g.\ the resonant mode in the single-mode approximation) be $\hat{a}$ and $\hat{a}^\dag$, respectively, where the time dependence is implicit, these operators obey $[\hat{a},\hat{a}^\dag]=1$ and $\hat{a}\lvert\emptyset\rangle=0$ where $\lvert\emptyset\rangle$ is the vacuum state. Given a Hamiltonian $\hat H$, these Heisenberg operators evolve according to the Heisenberg equation-of-motion $\dot{\hat{a}}=-\frac{i}{\hbar} [\hat a, \hat H]$ and the conjugate equation-of-motion. Let the time-domain quadrature of this mode be $\hat{X}_\theta=\frac{e^{-i \theta}\hat{a}+e^{i \theta}\hat{a}}{\sqrt{2}}$ and let $\hat{X}_1=\hat{X}_{\theta=0},\; \hat{X}_2=\hat{X}_{\theta=\frac{\pi}{2}}$ such that $[\hat{X}_1,\hat{X}_2]=i$. Therefore, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for the amplitude quadrature $\hat{X}_1$ and phase quadrature $\hat{X}_2$ states that $\sigma_{X_1}\sigma_{X_2}\geq\frac{1}{2}\abs{\ev{[\hat{X}_1,\hat{X}_2]}}=\frac{1}{2}$ where the uncertainty is $\sigma_\mathcal{O}=\sqrt{\ev{\hat{\mathcal{O}}^2}-\ev{\hat{\mathcal{O}}}^2}$ and $\ev{\hat{\mathcal{O}}}=\langle\emptyset\lvert\hat{\mathcal{O}}\rvert\emptyset\rangle$ is the vacuum expectation value~\cite{}. That these quadratures are related to the amplitude and the phase of the light, respectively, matters only to understanding but can indeed be shown~\cite{Danilishin}. More importantly, these time-domain quadratures are Hermitian and therefore observable~\footnote{Which is what is meant by ``measuring the phase'' of the light. Even though absolute phase is not real, the phase quadrature is observable.} which is used to ultimately measure the gravitational-wave signal. Their related uncertainties, however, mean that any measurement that depends on both of the quadratures must contend with there always being some quantum noise present. This is the case for gravitational-wave interferometry: the quantum noise can be reduced but never eliminated. 
As an aside, the exact method of readout of the quadratures is not of concern to this thesis, but it suffices to say that a readout scheme like homodyne readout will suffice for all applications shown here~\cite{}.

It is worth also understanding the Fourier-domain counterparts to the quadratures, since these contain spectral information about the gravitational-wave signal and Fourier transforms are the primary method of solving Heisenberg equations-of-motion throughout this thesis. Let $\hat{\mathcal{O}}(\Omega) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{\mathrm{d}t}{\sqrt{2}} \hat{\mathcal{O}} e^{-i\Omega t}$ where the time-dependence is implicit in $\hat{\mathcal{O}}$. Then, let $\hat{X}_\theta(\Omega)=\frac{e^{-i \theta}\hat{a}(\Omega)+e^{i \theta}\hat{a}^\dag(-\Omega)}{\sqrt{2}}$ where careful attention should be made to the sign of the last argument which was flipped in order to accommodate the $e^{-i\Omega t}$ in the Fourier transform. While the time-domain quadratures are Hermitian, $\hat{X}^\dag=\hat{X}$, the Fourier-domain quadratures are not and instead obey $\hat{X}^\dag(\Omega)=\hat{X}(-\Omega)$. Although not Hermitian, these Fourier-domain quantities are indirectly observable either through their time-domain counterparts or through measurements that can derive their real and imaginary parts, ultimately made possible due to the condition $\hat{X}^\dag(\Omega)=\hat{X}(-\Omega)$~\cite{sourcecitedinReid}. This detail will not be considered further and I will refer to these quadratures as being observable. 
In the Fourier domain, the time-domain variances $V_\mathcal{O}=\sigma_\mathcal{O}^2$ are replaced by (single-sided) spectral densities $S_\mathcal{O}(\Omega)\delta(\Omega-\Omega')=\ev{\hat{\mathcal{O}}(\Omega)\circ\hat{\mathcal{O}}^\dag(\Omega')}$ where $A\circ B=\dfrac{1}{2}(A\cdot B+B\cdot A)$. For $\hat{a}(\Omega)$ corresponding to an uncorrelated vacuum state, let $\ev{\hat{X}_i(\Omega)\circ\hat{X}_j^\dag(\Omega')}=\delta_{i,j}\delta(\Omega-\Omega')$ where $\delta_{i,j}$ is the Kronecker delta, and therefore $S_X^\text{vac}=1$ can be shown from the commutation relations above~\cite{Danilishin}. Finally, there is a subtlety in these spectral density expressions in that I have assumed that the quadrature operators are corresponding to the time-domain quantum fluctuations of the amplitude and phase of the light around its time-independent classical expectation value, i.e.\ I am really considering Fourier transforms of $\delta\hat{X}(t)=\hat{X}(t)-\ev{\hat{X}}$ where I have made the time-dependences explicit for clarity. However, I will leave the $\delta$'s implicit to compactify notation.


	% At high frequencies, the sensitivity of current detectors is limited by quantum noise arising from the quantum nature of light~\cite{danilishinQuantumMeasurementTheory2012}. By the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, the amplitude and phase of a quantum state of light (including the vacuum) cannot be exactly known at the same time. Uncertainty in the amplitude of the light within the interferometer leads to quantum radiation pressure noise, while uncertainty in its phase leads to so-called “shot noise”. 

\subsection{Optical loss and decoherence}

\end{figure}

% So, quantum noise is just caused by uncertainties in the state of detector
Quantum noise from fundamental uncertainty in the light of a cavity-based detector can be thought of as entering the detector through every open port and lossy optic~\cite{}. So far, the explanation introduced above is that quantum noise is caused by fundamental uncertainties in the state of the detector, so what does the previous statement mean? % too colloquial?
The key insight is that any state of light in the detector can be written in terms of transformations of the vacuum state, and so any uncertainty in the state of the light can be expressed as vacuum fluctuations (corresponding to $S_X^\text{vac}=1$ above) viewed under such transformations~\cite{}. Therefore, the source of the quantum noise is ultimately the vacuum, which can be thought to surround the detector and enter whenever the system is opened to its surroundings~\footnote{This language is potentially confusing, because the vacuum does not travel and therefore can not enter, but it is shorthand for considering how the system interacts with the surrounding fields -- how light can leak out of and into the detector.}. An open port is the term for such a point where light can enter and leave the detector, such as at the photodetector where the detector is necessarily always open~\cite{}. This is worth emphasising, measurement requires the detector to be coupled to the environment and guarantees a port for the vacuum -- this notion of quantum noise is not well-defined for a closed system. Soon, I will express this notion mathematically, but first it needs to be explained why lossy optics should also be a source of quantum noise.

% fluctuation-dissipation theorem
Optical loss refers to the energy lost from a light field upon propagation or interaction with an optic, e.g. if $90\%$ of the power incident on a mirror is reflected but only $5\%$ transmitted, then the remaining $5\%$ of the power has been lost to the environment. The chief mechanism for optical loss is dissipation into the thermal bath, i.e.\ heating of the mirror~\cite{}. The Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem states that any such dissipation into the thermal bath is accompanied by the introduction of uncorrelated noise into the light field~\cite{}. As such, the loss mechanism in an optic can be modelled by a beamsplitter that releases energy into the environment and creates a new open port for vacuum to enter through, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:beamsplitter_loss}. In this Beamsplitter Model of Optical Loss, all optics are perfect (i.e.\ the power incident equals the sum of the power reflected and transmitted) but additional open ports are added throughout the detector -- so-called loss ports. It suffices to have a single loss port in every cavity, i.e.\ for every mode, since the uncorrelated vacuum from multiple sources of loss sum in quadrature and is equivalent to a single vacuum source from a lossier port -- which should be clearer later. %is or are?
This means that any other open ports in the detector, besides any used for measurement, can also be rolled into the loss ports. Therefore, the quantum noise in a cavity-based detector comes from vacuum entering at the measurement device and from loss ports in every mode.

% decoherence and the effect of mixing with the vacuum
% This mathematical formalism is useful but it leaves the effect of the loss ports vague 
The physical effect of optical loss is to decohere the state of the light -- reduce correlations and pull the quantum noise back towards its vacuum value of $S_X=1$. This will be demonstrated later, but the effect can be understood using the above notion of optical loss as the introduction of uncorrelated vacuum (along with the actual loss of power). The reflected light from a loss port is some linear combination of the vacuum and the incident light, where conservation of energy in the beamsplitter model of loss means that the linear combination is normalised. This means that the quantum noise of the reflected light can be considered an average of the incident light and the vacuum value of $1$ -- the idea that mixing with the vacuum pulls the quantum noise back towards $1$. The correlations of the light between two different modes similarly is pulled towards the vacuum, and since the vacuum is uncorrelated this means reducing the correlations (towards $0$). Where the correlation between quadratures $\hat{X}_i, \hat{X}_j$ is given by the co-variance (or off-diagonal term in the spectral density matrix seen later) $\ev{\hat{X}_i(\Omega)\circ\hat{X}_j^\dag(\Omega')}$, which is not real but is indirectly observable like the quadratures themselves~\cite{}. That optical loss also decoheres the state is important to techniques that seek to reduce the quantum noise by introducing correlations, such as some of those explored in this thesis.

Finally, using this notion of quantum noise, I can write down the quantum noise response of a cavity-based detector. %how arbitrary is this?
Let the quadrature measured at the photodetector (PD) of an arbitrary detector be $\hat{X}_\text{PD}(\Omega)$. This will be determined by the noise quadratures $\hat{X}_i^\text{vac}(\Omega)$ of the vacuum input at each open port and source of optical loss indexed by $i$, the signal $\tilde{h}(\Omega)$, and the detector's linear response to each of these, expressed by the noise $R_i(\Omega)$ and signal $T(\Omega)$ transfer functions (where the frequency dependence will often be implicit henceforth): $$\hat X_\text{PD}(\Omega)=\sum_i R_i \hat X_i^\text{vac}(\Omega) + T \tilde h(\Omega).$$
These transfer functions capture the behaviour of the detector, including the impact on the optical quantum noise by coupling to non-optical modes such as the mechanical mode of a suspended mirror -- more on this later. 
The quantum noise measured by the detector is then simply $\hat X_\text{PD}(\Omega)|_{\tilde h=0}$, i.e.\ the output with the signal turned off. This quantum noise can be characterised by its spectral density, $S_X$, in $\text{Hz}^{-1/2}$ which can be simplified assuming uncorrelated vacuum inputs (which is reasonable for all purposes in this thesis~\cite{}) to the sum of squares: $$S_X(\Omega)=\sum_i \abs{R_i}^2(\Omega).$$ 
Since the transfer functions $R_{i_1}, R_{i_2}$ for two loss ports in the same cavity are the same up to the respective loss rates $\sqrt\gamma_{i_1}, \sqrt\gamma_{i_2}$, the two ports can be collapsed to a single loss port with loss rate $\sqrt{\gamma_{i_1}+\gamma_{i_2}}$ since $$\abs{R_{i_1}}^2+\abs{R_{i_2}}^2=\abs{\sqrt{\gamma_{i_1}}R}^2+\abs{\sqrt{\gamma_{i_2}}R}^2=\abs{\sqrt{\gamma_{i_1}+\gamma_{i_2}}R}^2.$$ This explains the claim made before that only one loss port is needed for each mode; an explanation of the loss rates $\gamma$ will be given later in the next section.

\subsection{Quantum noise response of an interferometric gravitational-wave detector}

\jam{(This section talks about the quantum noise response but does not derive it, should I display the two-mode Michelson QN response function here, perhaps?)}

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	% \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{}
	\caption{Response of a two-cavity conventional detector, shown in Fig.~\ref{}, to quantum radiation pressure noise, shot noise, and total quantum noise. At kilohertz, shot noise is the dominant form of quantum noise. The Standard Quantum Limit (SQL) is shown in the signal-normalised curve \jam{(does this need to be a three-panel N, S, NSR plot?)}.}
	\label{fig:simplifed_QN_response_conventional}
\end{figure}

This understanding of quantum noise can be applied to an interferometric detector, which has two sources of quantum noise: (1) radiation pressure noise and (2) shot noise. 
% mention back-action as QPRN, mention free-falling mass in horizontal direction approximation
For an interferometer, the position of the test mass has a fundamental uncertainty of its own, but this uncertainty is captured through the quantum noise transfer function of the detector which accounts for the addition of this mechanical mode through solving for its impact on the optical mode. The contribution to the quantum noise is known as quantum radiation pressure noise. 
This impact can be understood physically: the amplitude quadrature of the arm cavity mode couples to the test mass through radiation pressure~\cite{}, therefore quantum fluctuations in the amplitude quadrature lead to uncertainty in the position of the test masses, and visa versa~\cite{Danilishin?}. The response of the detector to this noise is related to the resonance behaviour of the mechanical mode, i.e.\ the resonances of the suspended pendulum that is the test mass. In reality, the suspension chain in a detector like Advanced LIGO has non-trivial response due to the coupling of different mechanical modes, but this response becomes simpler above the main pendulum resonance(s)~\cite{}. Because the frequencies that I am interested in lie above $100$~Hz and these resonances, I will approximate the test mass as free-falling horizontally, i.e.\ that it is resonant at DC, $0$~Hz. This approximation is commonly made in the literature when studying the kilohertz response of interferometric detectors~\cite{}. The result of this approximation is that the quantum radiation pressure noise response of an interferometric detector is given by \jam{(radiation pressure formula)}~\cite{}, decreasing with increasing frequency.

The rest of the quantum noise comes from the optical mode itself, e.g.\ from the vacuum from each loss port. Physically, this quantum noise manifests as so-called ``shot noise'' at the photodetector -- uncertainty in the number of photons incident on the photodetector~\cite{}. While quantum radiation pressure noise appears (with the gravitational-wave signal) in the amplitude quadrature in the arms, shot noise appears in all quadratures as it is associated with the vacuum \jam{(what happened to shot noise being associated with the phase quadrature? why is it conjugate to QRPN?)}. The shot noise response of an interferometric detector is given by \jam{(two-cavity shot noise response)}~\cite{}, flat with frequency, which will be shown later. This means that at kilohertz, shot noise is the dominant source of quantum noise as quantum radiation pressure noise falls off while shot noise remains flat, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:simplifed_QN_response_conventional}. This means that improving the quantum noise at kilohertz requires improving the shot noise, which is what this thesis focuses on. 

% Similarly, uncertainty in the phase of the light (its phase quadrature) incident on a photodetector affects the counting statistics of the photodetector and therefore leads to uncertainty in the intensity and ultimately so-called ``shot noise'' in the measurement of the signal~\cite{}.  \jam{(What is a counting statistic, explain this better)} %\jam{(phase isn't real, clarify this)} phase quadrature is measurable
% And so, (1) for an interferometer, the final measurement is affected by uncertainties in both quadratures of the light, but at different points in the detector (this will be clearer when I give a formal model in the next chapter), and (2) the quantum noise can be divided into the effects of shot noise, associated with the photodetector and the loss ports of the detector, and radiation pressure noise, associated with the test mass mechanical mode. \jam{(Clarify the association of loss ports with shot noise, what is shot noise only?)}

% Similarly, the positions and momenta of the test masses in a gravitational-wave detector are conjugate quantities. This introduces strange consequences of detection, e.g.\ as the position measurement of a test mass improves, its momentum becomes increasingly uncertain which couples through radiation pressure to the arm cavity mode~\cite{}. \jam{(follow up on this, what does this cause?)} 
% These consequences place limits on the quantum noise--limited sensitivity, i.e.\ the signal to quantum noise ratio, of a detector that cannot be surpassed by classical means which will be explained further later.

	% At high frequencies, shot noise is the dominant source of quantum noise and limits the sensitivity of current detectors. Therefore, reducing shot noise at high frequencies is the principal way to improve high-frequency sensitivity.

\subsubsection{Limits on improving the quantum noise}

% SQL
% review QCRB again? but did Mizuno Limit on the integrated sensitivity in Introduction?
The factors limiting the quantum noise--limited sensitivity of a gravitational wave detector were discussed in Chapter~\ref{chp:introduction}. Since the signal transfer function falls off at kilohertz because of the arm cavity resonance and the quantum radiation pressure noise starts dominating the quantum noise below $10$~Hz, there is a window of detection around $100$~Hz where the sensitivity is greatest. In particular, there is a point where the two contributions to quantum noise are equal, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:simplifed_QN_response_conventional}. The trade-off between the two \jam{(need to explain this tradeoff somewhere above, formulae should help)} means that \jam{(... Will need to read up on SQL and QCRB to write this section properly.)}
 %changing interferometer parameters (except for circulating power)
This is known as the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL) for interferometric detection and is an instance of a more general result about quantum noise~\cite{}. Beating the Standard Quantum Limit is not possible using classical techniques but is possible using quantum technology such as squeezing, the focus of the next chapter. This is similar to the Mizuno Limit on the integrated sensitivity described in Chapter~\ref{chp:introduction}, which comes from the Quantum Cramer-Rao Bound, an even more fundamental limit on quantum noise based on the information available~\cite{}, which is also able to be beaten by the correlations introduced through squeezing but not by \jam{(... what? can't just say classical techniques again, really need to read up to make this work)}.
\jam{(this paragraph should motivate the need for squeezing it is almost there but misses many technical details)}
These limits on improving the quantum noise motivate the need for technologies like squeezing which manipulate the quantum state beyond just changing the classical interferometer.

\section{Squeezing}
\label{sec:squeezing_background}

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	% \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{}
	\caption{Ball-and-stick illustration of squeezing.}
	\label{fig:ballandstick_simple}
\end{figure}

% return to HUP
% ball-and-stick plot
Squeezing refers to a broad range of technologies that all manipulate the quantum noise through exchanging uncertainty in one quantity for its conjugate quantity, such as the decreasing the quantum noise in the amplitude quadrature (e.g.\ by some factor $e^r$) by increasing the noise in the phase quadrature, while still obeying the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle~\cite{}: $$(\frac{\sigma_{X_1}}{e^r}) (e^r\sigma_{X_2})\geq\frac{1}{2}\label{eq:HUP_squeezed}$$. A simple illustration of this is shown in Fig~\ref{fig:ballandstick_simple} where the trade-off of uncertainties is visualised as a literal squeezing of the noise ellipse, where the product of the semi-axes is maintained (or increased) to obey the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. This is advantageous when the noise in one quantity matters more than the other, such as in interferometric detectors where, e.g.\ with homodyne readout, one quadrature is measured at the photodetector and noise in the other quadrature does not affect the measurement~\cite{}. \jam{(Not so simple as just ignoring the other quadrature, what about squeezing shot noise to increase QRPN?)} The full story is more complicated, e.g.\ squeezing to decrease shot noise increases quantum radiation pressure noise in the final measurement, but this will be explained at the end of this section when I cover frequency-dependent external squeezing. Squeezing can also be explained using sideband theory~\cite{} but I do not use it in this thesis.

\end{figure}

% production of squeezed states, PDC, give a citation to answer Ilya's question
% Although I will model the crystal as a ``black-box'' that contributes some term to the Hamiltonian
Optical squeezing can be achieved via a variety of techniques~\cite{}, but in this thesis I will focus on the production of squeezed states by shining light through nonlinear crystals~\cite{}. In a crystal with a quadratic (nonlinear) polarisability, i.e.\ when exposed to an electric field $\vec E$ it produces an electric field $\varepsilon_0 \sum_{n=0}^\infty \chi^{(n)} {\vec E}^n$~\cite{ ref in Kirk thesis?} \jam{(check this expression)} where the quadratic co-efficient dominates $\abs{\chi^{(2)}}\gg\abs{\chi^{(n)}},\; n\neq2$, the process of parametric down-conversion can occur~\cite{}. In this process, a photon of a \jam{(particular?)} ``pump'' frequency $\omega_p$ is annihilated to create two entangled, squeezed photons at lower frequencies $\omega_0,\; \omega_0+\Delta$ such that $\omega_p=2\omega_0+\Delta$ to conserve energy~\cite{}. The frequency difference $\Delta$, chosen by how the crystal is pumped, is typically small in comparison to the other frequencies in the system, and when $\Delta=0$ the produced photons are degenerate which dramatically changes the mode structure of the system (this will be revisited later); the energy level structure of the process is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:PDC_deg_and_nondeg}. That the photons produced in parametric down-conversion are squeezed will be shown in the next section. %, but that they are entangled follows from their shared point of creation. 
\jam{(Why does this happen in the crystal, what about quadratic nonlinearity makes squeezing happen?)}. Although this process can annihilate and create photons of many different frequencies \jam{(can it?)}, in the single-mode approximation that I maintain throughout this thesis I will only consider the down-conversion involving a particular pump frequency $2\omega_0+\Delta$ and carrier frequency $\omega_0$ -- that of the main laser in the interferometer (but more on that later). This is justified by the same reasoning as before, the cavities pick-out their resonant frequencies and all other frequencies can be ignored~\cite{}. And I assume that wherever the squeezer crystal is placed, the pump frequency and the two produced frequencies (called the signal $\omega_0$ and idler $\omega_0+\Delta$ frequencies) are resonant (i.e. the effects of detuning are not considered in this thesis).

Before constructing a Hamiltonian model of squeezing, I need to make three clarifications to reduce confusion. Firstly, although one can imagine a green laser beam incident on a crystal squeezing two slightly differently coloured red lasers also incident, squeezing is often used to squeeze the vacuum of virtual photons at the signal and idler (or just signal if degenerate) modes which can be initially confusing. Abstractly, this corresponds to the coherent amplitudes of the incident modes being zero, i.e.\ the ellipse in Fig.~\ref{fig:ballandstick_simple} instead being centred at the origin. This means that I need to distinguish between the squeezed vacuum from a squeezer and true vacuum, where the ellipse in Fig.~\ref{fig:ballandstick_simple} is circular and centred at the origin and corresponds to the $S_X=1$ value. 
% can these latter general comments (frequency, dB) be moved into dOPO section where they will make more sense?
Secondly, throughout this thesis I consider the quantum noise response of a detector and talk about the quantum noise being squeezed (suppressed) or anti-squeezed (amplified) at different frequencies. This should not be confused with the squeezer interacting with different frequencies, rather, the squeezer still interacts with the same frequencies of the single-mode approximation but the response considers the spectra of their respective quadratures (i.e.\ the distinction between the frequency annihilated by ${\hat a} (\Omega)$ and its spectrum with respect to frequency $\Omega$). Finally, in the squeezing literature, there is potential confusion when quantifying the amount of squeezing produced. If $S_X$ is scaled (squeezed) by a factor $e^{-r}$, like the first variance in Eq.~\ref{eq:HUP_squeezed}, then typically~\cite{} the quantum noise response $\sqrt S_X$ is plotted logarithmically in amplitude-decibels (dB) as $20 \log_{10}(\sqrt {S_X e^{-r}})=20 \log_{10}(\sqrt S_X) - 20\log_{10}(e^{r/2})$ with the vacuum ($S_X=1$) at $0$~dB. Given the potential confusion, I reserve the term ``squeezing factor'' for the parameter $\chi$ seen shortly in the Hamiltonian model, although it can refer to $e^r$ or $e^{r/2}$ or various other related quantities~\cite{}.

% just a paragraph about sidebands?, I do not go further into this because I do not use the formalism (preferring the operator+Interaction Picture which achieves the same effect of studying frequency offsets)


	% An established technology to reduce shot noise at high frequencies is squeezing~\cite{danilishinQuantumMeasurementTheory2012,chuaQuantumEnhancementKm2015}. Squeezing manipulates the quantum state of light and the vacuum to trade-off phase uncertainty for amplitude uncertainty; this decreases shot noise by increasing quantum radiation pressure noise~\footnote{Squeezing only improves sensitivity if the interferometer readout is suitably designed to exploit the trade-off between shot noise and radiation pressure noise.}. Squeezed states of light can be created in a crystal with nonlinear polarisability by parametric down-conversion which annihilates a photon at a pump frequency and creates two entangled photons with ``squeezed" uncertainties. To conserve energy, the sum of the frequencies of the created photons must equal the pump frequency. This process is degenerate if the frequencies of the created photons are equal and is nondegenerate otherwise.
	% The fact that nondegenerate squeezing involves three distinct frequencies (the pump and the two created frequencies) rather than two is an important change in the symmetry of the system that I will revisit later.
	% An example application of squeezing to reduce shot noise is the injection of squeezed vacuum from an external, degenerate squeezer which is used to approximately halve the shot noise in current detectors~\cite{tseQuantumEnhancedAdvancedLIGO2019}. The squeezed vacuum is injected behind the signal-recycling mirror via a Faraday isolator placed outside the signal-recycling cavity as shown in the left panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:coupled_cavities}.


\subsection{Degenerate OPO}
% this is quite long for a subsection?

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	% \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{}
	\caption{Degenerate OPO, all modes are shown.}
	\label{fig:dOPO_config}
\end{figure}

A degenerate optical parametric oscillator (OPO) consists of a squeezer crystal inside of an optical cavity, operating in the degenerate regime (i.e.\ producing two squeezed photons at the same frequency for each pump photon annihilated), as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:dOPO_config}. This configuration is the essential squeezing set-up and is well-studied in the literature~\cite{}. I examine this configuration here for two main reasons: (1) to show that the photons produced in parametric down-conversion are squeezed and (2) to demonstrate the analytic, Hamiltonian model that I will use throughout the rest of this thesis (this approach is used widely in the literature~\cite{}).  
% In Fig.~\ref{fig:dOPO_config}, the pump laser is shown incident orthogonally on the crystal to the beam path, this is only somewhat realistic~\cite{} and spatial aspects of the configuration are not included in the model. 
To simplify the model, I make the single-mode approximation and assume that the pump laser down-converts into the cavity mode. Vacuum at the cavity mode frequency enters the cavity through the main, readout port (connected to the photodetector) and through an intra-cavity loss port, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:dOPO_config}. 
% OPO = squeezed cavity with no seed light
In the literature, a distinction is sometimes made between when the squeezed field is ``seeded'' or not, i.e.\ whether the degenerate OPO produces squeezed vacuum or squeezed light, and in the latter case the OPO is instead called an optical parametric amplifier (OPA). Since I am interested in the quantum noise response, i.e.\ the response to vacuum noise, this is indeed the former case. 
% But since I am interested in the quantum noise response of this configuration, i.e.\ how vacuum noise appears in the final measurement, I do not need to worry about this distinction. % is this even necessary to bring up then?
To further simplify the model, I ignore the dynamics of the pump laser through approximating it as an un-depletable reservoir of photons. Formally, this means that I make a semi-classical approximation to the pump mode and then approximate its coherent amplitude as constant (the ``no pump depletion'' assumption). This approximation is widely used in the literature~\cite{} (although models with pump depletion accounted for exist~\cite{}) and is valid in the parameter regime that I remain in -- to be explained more later.

\subsubsection{Analytic model}
% analytic model to demonstrate Hamiltonian method

I derive the quantum noise response of a degenerate OPO using a Hamiltonian approach. Let the modes of this system be as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:dOPO_config}: $\hat u$ for the pump at frequency $2\omega_0$, $\hat b$ for the signal (squeezed) cavity mode at frequency $\omega_0$ (assuming that $\hat b$ is resonant is where the single-mode approximation is made), $\hat n^L_b$ for the vacuum entering the intra-cavity loss port, $\hat B_\text{in}$ for the vacuum entering the readout port, $\hat B_\text{out}$ for the signal mode leaving the readout port, $\hat n^L_\text{PD}$ for the vacuum entering the detection loss port, and $\hat B_\text{PD}$ for the signal mode incident on the photodetector, i.e.\ after the detection loss port. I want to derive $\hat B_\text{PD}$ as a function of the vacuum inputs, to do so I will first solve for $\hat b$ and then propagate~\footnote{Spatial propagation is not part of this model, I mean that I will use the appropriate input/output relations~\cite{} to find the detected mode.} the solution to the photodetector. The Hamiltonian of this system is given by $\hat H = \hat H_0 + \hat H_I + \hat H_\gamma$ where $\hat H_0$ gives the decoupled dynamics of $\hat u, \hat b$, $\hat H_I$ gives the parametric down-conversion in the squeezer crystal, and $\hat H_\gamma$ gives the coupling through the readout and each loss port, these are as follows~\cite{}: \jam{(fill in readout term, look at Korobko?)}
\begin{align}
\hat H_0 &= \hbar \omega_0 \hat b^\dag \hat b + \hbar 2 \omega_0 \hat u^\dag \hat u\\
\hat H_I &= i \hbar \frac{x}{2} e^{i\phi} \hat u (\hat b^\dag)^2 + \text{h.c.}\\
\hat H_\gamma &= \int \ldots .
\end{align}
Where $x$ is the real coupling constant of the down-conversion, $\phi$ is the phase of the pump laser, $\text{h.c.}$ represents the Hermitian conjugate of the rest of the expression (and represents the reverse, second-harmonic generation~\cite{} process where two $\omega_0$ photons combine to make an $2\omega_0$ photon), and $\gamma_b, \gamma^b_R$ are the coupling rates through the intra-cavity loss port and the readout port respectively. These coupling rates (in Hz) are related to the transmission through their respective ports $T_{l,b}, T_R$ and the round-trip time for the cavity $\tau = \frac{L_\text{rt}}{c}$ ($L_\text{rt}$ is the round-trip length of the cavity) by $\gamma = -\frac{1}{2\tau}\log(1-T)$~\cite{}. The detection loss will be dealt with using an input/output relation later in the derivation, which is easier, although it could be written explicitly in the Hamiltonian~\cite{}. 

For this Hamiltonian, the Heisenberg-Langevin equation-of-motion~\cite{} for $\hat b$, given by $\dot\hat b=-\frac{i}{\hbar}[\hat b,\hat H]$, is as follows (with the Langevin input/output terms coming from $H_\gamma$): $$\dot{\hat{b}}= -i\omega_0 \hat b+x e^{i\phi} \hat u\hat b^\dag - \gamma^b_\mathrm{tot} \hat{b} + \sqrt{2\gamma^b_R}\hat{B}_\mathrm{in} + \sqrt{2\gamma_b}\hat{n}^L_b.$$ Where $\gamma^b_\text{tot}=\gamma^b_\text{R}+\gamma_b$. Now, I make the semi-classical pump and no pump depletion approximations to $\hat u$ to turn it into some constant coherent amplitude $u$ (determined by the classical pump power~\cite{}) and group it with the coupling co-efficient $x$ to form the squeezer parameter $\chi = x u$. So far, all of this working has been in the Heisenberg picture. Entering the Interaction Picture and separating out the dynamics of $\hat H_0$ onto the states and leaving $\hat H - \hat H_0$ to evolve the operators, like entering a rotating frame at $\hat b \mapsto e^{-i\omega_0 t} \hat b$ for each operator, removes the $-i\omega_0 \hat b$ term from the equation-of-motion leaving: $$\dot{\hat{b}}= \chi e^{i\phi}\hat b^\dag - \gamma^b_\mathrm{tot} \hat{b} + \sqrt{2\gamma^b_R}\hat{B}_\mathrm{in} + \sqrt{2\gamma_b}\hat{n}^L_b.$$ Since I am interested in the quantum noise, I also take the fluctuating components of each of these operators (leaving the $\delta \hat b\mapsto\hat b$ implicit as mentioned in Section~\ref{}) to ignore the classical dynamics, but since each of the input modes are vacuum $\delta\hat{B}_\mathrm{in}=\hat{B}_\mathrm{in}$ and similarly for $\hat{n}^L_b$. \jam{(That the classical amplitude for $\hat b$ remains zero is not obvious, the squeezer starts lasing at threshold so I need to clarify.)} The result is that the equation-of-motion is the same for the fluctuating components.

This equation-of-motion can then be solved algebraically via Fourier transform (where $\partial_t \mapsto -i \Omega$): $$(\gamma^b_\mathrm{tot}-i \Omega)\hat b(\Omega)=\chi e^{i\phi}\hat b^\dag(-\Omega)  + \sqrt{2\gamma^b_R}\hat{B}_\mathrm{in}(\Omega) + \sqrt{2\gamma_b}\hat{n}^L_b(\Omega).$$ Where $\Omega$ is now the angular frequency offset from $\omega_0$ due to the Interaction Picture/rotating frame. Algebraically, there are a few ways to arrive at the result, but I will demonstrate the linear algebra solution since it will be a useful method in the nondegenerate case where there are twice as many operators. Let $\vec{\hat{Q}}(\Omega)=[\hat{Q}(\Omega),\hat{Q}^\dag(-\Omega)]^\text{T}$ for each pair of annihilation/creation operators $\hat Q, \hat Q^\dag$ and take Hermitian conjugate and $\Omega\mapsto -\Omega$ of Eq.~\ref{} to find: 
\begin{align}\vec{\hat b}(\Omega)&=\text{M}_b^{-1}\left(\sqrt{2\gamma^b_R}\vec{\hat{B}}_\mathrm{in}(\Omega) + \sqrt{2\gamma_b}\vec{\hat{n}}^L_b(\Omega)\right)\\
\text{M}_b&=(\gamma^b_\mathrm{tot}-i \Omega)\text{I}-\chi \begin{bsmallmatrix}0 & e^{i\phi} \\e^{-i\phi} & 0\end{bsmallmatrix}.
\end{align}
Where $\text{I}$ is the 2 by 2 identity matrix. Using the input/output relation~\cite{} at the readout port: $$\vec{\hat{B}}_\mathrm{out}(\Omega)=\vec{\hat{B}}_\mathrm{in}(\Omega)-\sqrt{2\gamma^b_R}\vec{\hat b}(\Omega).$$ And the Beamsplitter Model of detection loss, with reflectivity $R_\text{PD}\in(0,1)$, before the photodetector: $$\vec{\hat{B}}_\mathrm{PD}(\Omega)=\sqrt{1-R_\text{PD}}\vec{\hat{B}}_\mathrm{out}(\Omega)+\sqrt{R_\text{PD}}\vec{\hat n}^L_\text{PD}(\Omega).$$ The light $\vec{\hat{B}}_\mathrm{PD}(\Omega)$ incident on the photodetector can be found, but since annihilation/creation operators are not observable, the quadratures (which are observable) need to be found. Let $\Gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt2} \begin{bsmallmatrix}1 & 1 \\-i & i\end{bsmallmatrix}$ such that the quadratures associated with some $\hat{Q}(\Omega)$ are given by $\vec{\hat{X}}_Q(\Omega)=[\hat{X}_{Q,1}(\Omega),\hat{X}_{Q,2}(\Omega)]^\text{T}=\Gamma \vec{\hat{Q}}(\Omega)$ (note the difference to $\vec{\hat{Q}}(\Omega)$, this is a vector of quadratures each of which obey $\hat{X}^\dag(-\Omega)=\hat{X}(\Omega)$). Putting it all together, I find the measured quadratures to be: 
\begin{align}
\label{eq:dOPO_PD_as_fn_of_vac}
\vec{\hat X}_\mathrm{PD}(\Omega)&=\sqrt{1-R_\text{PD}}\Gamma\left(\left(\text{I}-2\gamma^b_R\text{M}_b^{-1}\right)\Gamma^{-1}\vec{\hat X}_\mathrm{in}(\Omega)-2\sqrt{\gamma^b_R \gamma_b}\text{M}_b^{-1}\Gamma^{-1}\vec{\hat X}^L_b(\Omega)\right)\\
&+\sqrt{R_\text{PD}}\text{I}\;\vec{\hat X}^L_\text{PD}(\Omega).
\end{align}
Or, more compactly, as a linear combination of the three different (uncorrelated) vacuum sources, given by transfer matrices $\text{R}_\text{in},\text{R}^L_b, \text{R}^L_\text{PD}$ which can be derived from Eq.~\ref{eq:dOPO_PD_as_fn_of_vac}: $$\vec{\hat X}_\mathrm{PD}(\Omega)=\text{R}_\text{in}\vec{\hat X}_\mathrm{in}(\Omega)+\text{R}^L_b\vec{\hat X}^L_b(\Omega)+\text{R}^L_\text{PD}\vec{\hat X}^L_\text{PD}(\Omega).$$ This defines the quantum noise response of a detector as described abstractly in Section~\ref{sec:optical_loss_background}, where the total quantum noise measured at the photodetector is described by the spectral density matrix (Fourier domain covariance matrix): $$\text{S}_X(\Omega)=\text{R}_\text{in} \text{R}_\text{in}^\dag+\text{R}^L_b {\text{R}^L_b}^\dag+\text{R}^L_\text{PD}{\text{R}^L_\text{PD}}^\dag.$$ As in Section~\ref{sec:optical_loss_background}, the uncorrelated vacuum assumption was used to simplify $(\text{S}_X)_{i,j}(\Omega)\delta(\Omega-\Omega')=\ev{(\vec{\hat X}_\text{PD})_i(\Omega)\circ(\vec{\hat X}_\text{PD})_j^\dag(\Omega')}$ where $\ev{\ldots}$ is the vacuum expectation value as before. The diagonal elements of $\text{S}_X$ are the (Fourier domain) variances of ${\hat X}_{\mathrm{PD},1}(\Omega), {\hat X}_{\mathrm{PD},2}(\Omega)$ and the off-diagonal elements (noting that $\text{S}_X$ is manifestly Hermitian) give the covariance between the two quadratures.

This demonstrates the Hamiltonian method that I will use throughout the rest of this thesis, with later configurations just adding more modes to the Hamiltonian. % Overall, the method is robust \jam{(why?)} and easy to perform computationally 

\subsubsection{Results: demonstrating squeezing}

Having now found the quantum noise response, I can demonstrate that parametric down-conversion leads to squeezing the variances of the measured quadratures $(\text{S}_X)_{1,1}, (\text{S}_X)_{2,2}$. Computing $\text{S}_X$ requires matrix algebra which I perform using Wolfram Mathematica~\cite{} throughout this thesis. Doing so shows that (in agreement with previous results~\cite{}): 
$$\text{S}_X(\Omega)=\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
 1+\frac{(1-R_\text{PD})4 \gamma^b_R \chi  \left(2 \gamma^b_\text{tot} \chi +\left({\gamma^b_\text{tot}}^2+\chi ^2+\Omega ^2\right) \cos (\phi )\right)}{\left({\gamma^b_\text{tot}}^2-\chi ^2\right)^2+2 \Omega ^2 \left({\gamma^b_\text{tot}}^2+\chi ^2\right)+\Omega ^4} 
 & \frac{(1-R_\text{PD})4 \gamma^b_R \chi  \left({\gamma^b_\text{tot}}^2+\chi ^2+\Omega ^2\right) \sin (\phi )}{\left({\gamma^b_\text{tot}}^2-\chi ^2\right)^2+2 \Omega ^2 \left({\gamma^b_\text{tot}}^2+\chi ^2\right)+\Omega ^4} \\
 \frac{(1-R_\text{PD})4 \gamma^b_R \chi  \left({\gamma^b_\text{tot}}^2+\chi ^2+\Omega ^2\right) \sin (\phi )}{\left({\gamma^b_\text{tot}}^2-\chi ^2\right)^2+2 \Omega ^2 \left({\gamma^b_\text{tot}}^2+\chi ^2\right)+\Omega ^4} 
 & 1+\frac{(1-R_\text{PD})4 \gamma^b_R \chi  \left(2 \gamma^b_\text{tot} \chi -\left({\gamma^b_\text{tot}}^2+\chi ^2+\Omega ^2\right) \cos (\phi )\right)}{\left({\gamma^b_\text{tot}}^2-\chi ^2\right)^2+2 \Omega ^2 \left({\gamma^b_\text{tot}}^2+\chi ^2\right)+\Omega ^4} \\
\end{array}
\right].$$
\jam{(Need to show that this reduces to the more familiar expression with just $(\gamma^b_\text{tot}-\chi)^2+\Omega^2$ denominator when $\phi=0$.)}
The general form of $\text{S}_X(\Omega)$ is common to all configurations in this thesis: all elements are rational functions of $\Omega, \chi$, diagonal elements are often simpler when put in the form $1 + \Delta S$ since they are perturbations from the vacuum value of $1$, and off-diagonal elements (although real here, can be complex in general) obey the Hermitiancy of $\text{S}_X$. If the squeezer is turned off, $\chi=0$, then the output is just vacuum $\text{S}_X=\text{I}$. Looking at the Hamiltonian, only $\phi$ (and the sign of $\chi$, although I will try to keep $\chi$ non-negative and just vary the phase using $\phi$) will break the symmetry between the quadratures \jam{(what do I mean here, this is more obvious from the plots?)}. When $\phi=0$, then the covariance vanishes and the variance simplifies to: $$(\text{S}_X)_{1,1}(\Omega)=1+\frac{(1-R_\text{PD})4 \gamma^b_R \chi}{\left({\gamma^b_\text{tot}}-\chi\right)^2+\Omega ^2}.$$ With the other quadrature having $(\text{S}_X)_{2,2}=(\text{S}_X)_{1,1}|_{\chi\mapsto-\chi}$. From these expressions, by inspection for $\phi=0, \chi>0$, one quadrature ($\hat X_1$) has increased uncertainty while the other quadrature ($\hat X_2$) has decreased uncertainty that is less than the vacuum value of $1$, these are the anti-squeezed (amplified) and squeezed quadratures respectively. In the lossless case, $R_\text{PD}=0, \gamma_b=0, \gamma^b_\text{tot}=\gamma^b_R$, then the results satisfy the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle as an equality: $$\label{eq:dOPO_HUP_sat}(\text{S}_X)_{1,1}(\text{S}_X)_{2,2}=\left(1+\frac{4 \gamma^b_R \chi}{\left(\gamma^b_R-\chi\right)^2+\Omega ^2}\right)\left(1-\frac{4 \gamma^b_R \chi}{\left(\gamma^b_R+\chi\right)^2+\Omega ^2}\right)=1.$$ And in the lossy case, as an inequality $(\text{S}_X)_{1,1}(\text{S}_X)_{2,2}\geq1$ \jam{(show this?)} which is an indication that optical losses decohere the system and can increase the overall uncertainty product. While understanding physically why parametric down-conversion produces squeezing~\cite{} is beyond the scope of this thesis, this derivation demonstrates it mathematically.

There remain a few effects visible in this simpler model that will return in later models and are therefore worth examining, namely: (1) the effect and bounds on increasing the squeezer parameter $\chi$, (2) the effect of intra-cavity loss $\gamma^b_\text{tot}-\gamma^b_R$ versus detection loss $R_\text{PD}$, and (3) the effect of pump phase $\phi$. In the lossless case with $\phi=0$ given by Eq.~\ref{eq:dOPO_HUP_sat}, one can see that increasing $\chi$ increases the distance from the vacuum state of the flat part of the quantum noise response, symmetrically for squeezing and anti-squeezing when $\sqrt S_X$ is plotted logarithmically, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:dOPO_variances}. In particular, the DC ($\Omega=0$) value of the anti-squeezed quadrature of the quantum noise is given by $1+\frac{4 \gamma^b_R \chi}{\left(\gamma^b_R-\chi\right)^2}$ which is singular at squeezer parameter $\chi_\text{thr}=\gamma^b_R$ at which point the squeezed quadrature is zero (to satisfy the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle exactly). This point $\chi_\text{thr}$ is known as the threshold~\cite{} of the degenerate OPO and serves as a boundary of this model's physicality, in particular of the assumption of no pump depletion. The notion of threshold can be understood from the perspective of gains and losses inside the cavity: the squeezer creates photons in the cavity mode at a rate proportional to $\chi$ which are lost from the cavity at a rate $\gamma^b_R$ (in the lossless case), when $\chi=\chi_\text{thr}$ the gain and loss balance and the state of the system changes as beyond $\chi_\text{thr}$ net photons appears in the cavity mode and the OPO starts lasing~\cite{}.
